Wrong product... it said iPad Air and it’s an iPad 4th gen. Not at all what I wanted but yes it’s in good shape and works for an old iPad!!
<<&&&&>>
I’m had a dent in the back
<<&&&&>>
Purchased this certified refurbished iPad Air in May of 2015 for $426.00 After the latest Apple update in February 2016 the iPad would crash after just a few minutes of operation. I have synced it multiple times, and tried every fix offered on Apple support. Finally made an appointment at the Apple store this weekend and advised by the Apple tech the iPad is toast. It has a hardware issue and cannot be repaired. I contacted Square Deals Inc. the company I purchased the iPad through Amazon from, and was advised the iPad is out of warranty after only 9 months. This is my fault for not researching this information. I'm out $426.00 after nine months of using this product with no recourse. I will never purchase another refurbished product from Square Trade and caution anyone else from doing the same.
<<&&&&>>
Love it!!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
There is no sims card in this. iPad. I assumed the sims card was always built in.....wrong. I think the information and description for this produce is misleading. It should clearly state. NO SIMS CARD so customer knows what the product is before buying. I would not bought it had I known. Betty M

Don't ever buy a refurbished Apple product. I bought a 5th generation iPod in April for about $175. The battery life started to degrade within a week or 2. After less than 20 uses at the gym, the battery lasted less than 15 minutes when fully charged. So, I ordered a replacement battery kit and when I took the refurbed unit apart today, I discovered that several internal clips were broken and 2 mounting screws were missing from a previous shoddy repair. The new battery install failed, and now I need to buy a new ipod. I'm buying new this time and getting a warranty.
<<&&&&>>
First I was worried about buying a used iPod but now I’m glad I did because I saved a bunch of money and I got a great product that works same !
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  The ipod is good. Looks clean though it came with a slight crack on the top right. and the earpods were missing.v
<<&&&&>>
freezes, has issues charging and staying charged so in this instance you get what you pay for- pretty much nothing.
<<&&&&>>
Too much stuff preloaded on it. I was only able to download part of my music library so you basically have to buy the 64
<<&&&&>>
Will not hold a charge, my daughter cannot use it if it is not plugged it. I tried to save $80 but ended up having to spend another $200 to replace this one with a new one. Not worth it.
<<&&&&>>
Extremely happy sometimes have to remind myself that it was used before. No problems at all everything was reset perfectly although it was packaged poorly. it came with a charger but with no transformer but I bought one an Eaglewood charger that was perfect.
<<&&&&>>
I love it. I have no complaints at this time.
<<&&&&>>
Bought for my daughter, she uses it everyday and it is a very well kept item. Perfect condition and works just like new.
<<&&&&>>
Love my I pod touch!!
<<&&&&>>
Is a little slow but that's to be expected from a last gen ipod. Overall it looks great (almost no ware) and is reliable.
<<&&&&>>
This iPod works great. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the hard shell case that it comes in was damaged and it didn't have the plug that the sub charger plugs into. But not a bad device at all
<<&&&&>>
The iPod would not hold the battery charge , I returned it
<<&&&&>>
This iPod will not stay charged for longer than two hours worth of use no matter how long we keep it plugged up for.
<<&&&&>>
Love the iPod I use it every day and is a lot easier to carry around while traveling love it works really great 😎
<<&&&&>>
Charged once. Loaded music. Played til battery was discharged. Battery will not recharge.
<<&&&&>>
great product but the apple headphones were not included and the seller has ignored my emails.
<<&&&&>>
Not up to date with latest iso, can’t upload apps!
<<&&&&>>
Low battery life
<<&&&&>>
Excellent!!!! Arrived very fast and items were as described. Will definitely purchase from seller in the future!!!!
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my grandson who is ten years old he loves it
<<&&&&>>
Did not hold charge very disappointed don’t buy this iPod
<<&&&&>>
Product came as described and very fast shipping. Our son enjoyed it for his birthday.
<<&&&&>>
So I got the iPod and can't even use it do to authorized credentials it needs to use it from the old owner
<<&&&&>>
Won't charge at all
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy it doesnt hold a charge.
<<&&&&>>

whats not to love
<<&&&&>>
My refurbished ipod touch is like new...very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
Works like a champ
<<&&&&>>
Didnot like it
<<&&&&>>
Works and looks new
<<&&&&>>
good for about 1.5 years but gets glitchy after that
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my boyfriend as a christmas present, its a great Ipod, everything works, it holds tons of games and music, and my boyfriend loves it.
<<&&&&>>
I think that the Ipod was in great condion, but the charger does not work at all for apple products. I am unsure as to why we got a charger cord that does not work!
<<&&&&>>
It came on time and it looks brand new with no scratches or marks on it, but the touch screen keeps freezing. At first I thought it might just be a glitch and after the first 2 days it started working again without problem. I've now had it for 12 days and rarely did it freeze, but since yesterday the touch screen functions are not working. I can't slide, open or close any applications, I couldn't even turn the thing off. Once I was able to deactivate it for the night, it turns back on, but the problem is still prominent and annoying as all hell!
<<&&&&>>
Its awesome!!!
<<&&&&>>
Awesome! No glitches or appearance mishaps so far 😊😊😊
<<&&&&>>
the product and the reviews seem to be VERY misleading about this product. When i got my iPod touch 5g i was very disappointed to find out that it does NOT have a back camera DESPITE reviews saying it does. I hope that i can find a way to return it.
<<&&&&>>
Pretty satisfied. One question. Having trouble installing Facebook any suggestions.. Thank you
<<&&&&>>
Omg I wish I can get another one I love it and would recommend to anyone
<<&&&&>>
It is an amazing gift for my family, and everyone loves it.
<<&&&&>>
The iPod is in nice shape, however the ad is not accurate. It does not include the charger; which is an original accessory. Also, it doesn't come in a box, so if this is a gift they'll know it is used. Very disappointed!
<<&&&&>>
Unfortunately this iPod was a fail. We bought it for our son for his birthday and within 2 weeks the home button wouldn’t function anymore. The battery life is terrible. What a waste of money.
<<&&&&>>
Even though I HATE APPLE, it's what my "traitor" daughter wanted. It was in great condition when it arrived, well packaged and has had no issues so far.
<<&&&&>>
excellent
<<&&&&>>
I received all of the iPods but one of them didn't come with the head phones or the cable
<<&&&&>>
Slow and glitchy. Save your money and buy directly from apple. I had to send it back.
<<&&&&>>
100% as advertised and I am 100% satisfied with the purchase. I would buy from the company again. Apple iPod touch 16GB (5th Generation) - Space Gray (Certified Refurbished)
<<&&&&>>
Arrived on time, packaged very well and in mint condition (refurbished). It was a great deal, my son loves it. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Very nice for the price (you can't beat refurbished).
<<&&&&>>
DO NOT BUY IT. It stopped working after 2 days of using it !!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
Item wa a supposed to be brand new, started going me issues within the first week of use. I couldn't listen to music with my headphones on without the voice control going haywire and fast forwarding the music, pausing tracks, skipping, and activating Siri and voice control when I shut off Siri. Called for a replacement , for my replacement and this one is now going me the same issues as well. This is ridiculous.
<<&&&&>>
Mine is icloud locked!!!
<<&&&&>>
Extremely useful
<<&&&&>>
Great! Minor scratches on the screen but its barely noticable
<<&&&&>>
I hace ti return it, it doesn’t work at all
<<&&&&>>
I do not like the battery. The battery jumped percentages. The phone lags every other minutes. I was on the phone with my girlfriend and the phone started buzzing out of control. The screen hesitates to my touch some times. The battery charged & drains to fast. The batty would drain fast then hit a random percentage & the battery would start draining normally from there.
<<&&&&>>
The. phone had a few dents and the screen was scratched up. It was also a remanufactured phone, not a refurbished phone.
<<&&&&>>
expensive phone and don't worth.the battery health only 70%.battery super bad.worst battery phone i ever used. And the bottom screw is rusty.
<<&&&&>>
TLDR: Great phone, looks new. Pay attention to who the seller is when you make your choice - the seller changes when you choose a different color. I bought from BuySPRY. All good so far. I was incredibly hesitant to buy a refurbished phone on Amazon after reading so many negative reviews on various products. I spent a lot of time researching my options and figured this one was probably my safest bet. Phone came in perfect condition (seriously, it looks brand new) and so far all the functions seem great. Set up was easy, unlocked, ready to set my fingerprint and everything. It's fast, sleek, and beautiful. Camera and audio are also great. What I learned: who the seller is is very important. Although all the phones on here are iPhone 6S 64GB, when you select a different color, the seller changes. When you scroll down and look at the section "Compare to similar items", you will see who the phone is sold by. Looking at the reviews, most of the negative reviews seemed to be associated with the Space Gray more than the other colors. I then looked rating of each seller for each color of the iPhone 6S 64GB and went from there. As of the time of this review, the Space Gray is listed as "Item Under Review" because of the customer feedback.
<<&&&&>>
This will be the 3rd iPhone 6s I have had to return for being defective! I am so sick of starting over with a new phone. Every iPhone was sold through Electronic Deals and this crap is unacceptable. I continue to purchase the same phone through the same vendor because i love the iPhone, it is priced reasonably and they are the lowest cost but this is not an option! I feel as though I should get some compensation for ALL my time and troubles! This iPhone is by far the worst yet, it freezes up and won’t open links it gets stuck on a letter or number and then won’t type it at all!!! Please make this next transction worth my while, say half price or better yet a complimentary iPhone wouldn’t hurt
<<&&&&>>
The product was defective and I wish I had chosen another retailer. It's not too late for you. 1. DEFECTIVE BATTERY - The phone was defective the day it arrived. The battery does not hold a charge consistently or indicate how long it will actually last. This defect is sporadic—so sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I thought I was doing something wrong at first so, after a few weeks of frustration, I did a test to see: tracking how long I charged and how long it lasted. This confirmed it was not my fault or a defective charger and that the phone I purchased from Electonic Deals was the problem. 2. QUESTIONABLE SECURITY - Since the day it arrived, I've had someone trying 'access the phone' remotely who is not me. I have never experienced this when I purchased a new phone or one from a credible phone reseller. 3. DEFECTIVE CAMERA - The camera stopped working entirely with no clear cause as I did not drop or damage it in any way prior to this malfunction (however, to be honest, I did scratch it in the corner but this was ironically just last week). All these problems lead to some unfortunate experiences. An unreliable phone can leave you stranded in dangerous situations: Once I charged the phone all day at work, and left late at night so I called a cab. The Electonic Deals phone died by the time I was outside, leaving me locked out and stranded. The cab never came and I had to walk through the city by myself at midnight. It can also risk your job: I had a 100% charge before going to bed so I did not plug it in to charge (reasonable) and it died before the morning so my alarm did not ring. I was late to work several times because of this and ended up buying an old alarm clock. Why didn't I send it back immediately? - Initially, I was not sure the battery issue was a defect. I tend to trust sellers and waited to verify this before accusing Electronic Deals of making a bad sale. - The requests to access my info made me not trust sending it back. Maybe it was Electonic Deals and, if I sent the phone back, I would be at risk of identity theft. I still don't trust this and will bring it to a techy friend to clear my data... - A cell phone is no small purchase. The time between returning it, receiving my money back, and purchasing a new one would leave me disconnected and out 1K. - Once I did confirm this, I had come up with a system: use it only when needed, carry an external battery and always have it plugged in when at work, home and near a power source. Ignore the requests from the mysterious person and hope for the best. Once the camera died, it was very doomed and clear I had been swindled by Electonic Deal. Note: After many emails, the company eventually said I could return the phone— however, they included terms that essentially negated the offer to take it back. Maybe the return terms were a mistake and they will send me my money back in full. However, I've received no gestures of good faith or indication that they sell working products or do fair business. I may have to take the $500 loss because it was my choice to test instead of returning immediately. So my advice is to pick another seller and, if you run into ANY issue, RETURN THE ELECTRONIC DEALS PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY. Rate them 1 star. As of this point, I do not trust them and don't think you should either. Also, if you have suggestions for another more credible retailer please share it with me in the comments so I can find a new working phone!

7/6/17 Just received my phone today! As far so good! Attached are the pictures of what I received in my package, only thing not pictured was the metal tool to pop out the SIM card tray. Overall very pleased with what I received!
<<&&&&>>
Got this for my daughter as her first smart phone. Wasn't going to spend $400-500 on a phone, so went the factory refurbished route. It is a very nice phone, looks new to me. came with non-OEM charger and cable, but it works so who cares. no ear phones but that's ok. What I liked is the availability of a 1 year protection plan that popped up with I placed this phone in my cart - the protection plan offers don't pop up for all the phone choices so I would place one in my cart the delete it if the protection plan wasn't offered, repeated until I found one that did. All in all I think a good buy. Square Trade provides the protection plan. I used them for a Kindle several years ago and they did a great job replacing it after my son broke it.
<<&&&&>>
Be VERY cautious about buying a phone from them!I purchased the iPhone 6s refurbished from this seller. Initially, the phone seemed to have no issues. As I continued to use it, the battery life got progressively worse. I am just past the 90 day warranty, and the phone will not charge anymore. So I am stuck with a defective phone & the seller is offering no solutions to resolve this issue. This was my second time purchasing this item, as the first iPhone 6s I purchased also had a problem with the camera. I strongly advise against buying a refurbished phone and will never do so again. Basically you are taking a gamble for your money. I thought I was saving money, but I wasted time, energy, and money in the long run. And do NOT buy from MyWit.
<<&&&&>>
I'm going to do a blunt review: 1. The phone came in three days, which was an awesome surprise because it had originally said 7. 2. The phone is looks new. No scratches, no dents. 3. It didn't come charged and booted up in about 5 minutes after plugging it in. 4. The phone WAS unlocked and the original language preference was set to Spanish. Aha. 5. It took a bit of "oomf" to open the sim card tray. I was a tad nervous after multiple attempts, but I pushed just a bit harder on the last try and the tray basically fell out. 6. About the battery: My battery health is at 81%. I've used it for about 3 hours at a rapid pace, downloading apps, setting stuff up -- and it did drain a tad, but I wouldn't expect anything different. I can bet money that it'll stay charged for at least another 4-5 hours with minimal usage. For anyone complaining about the battery, it's because of one or both reasons: A. You're simply glued to it and won't put it down. B. You have notifications on for everything, maybe maximum brightness, maybe multiple widgets? I highly recommend keeping these off, but I can't speak for everyone. What I do know is this: If you NEED all of those things, I'd recommend replacing the battery with something new. You can grab a DIY replacement for about $20 - you do NOT need to go to Apple for their specific battery. If you're like me that really could careless about having notifications/multiple widgets/etc on, the battery is literally FINE. 7. The device is extremely responsive and FAST. 8. It looks and feels sleek - was even thinner then I expected. 9. The rose-gold color is beautiful. 10. The device came with 5gb used out of 64gb. After downloading an intense amount of apps, I've used 7.4gb/64. Pretty awesome to not have to worry about space! 11. I think the price-point is fantastic for what you're getting. Yes, in about 2 years, updates will stop releasing on this model phone. However, considering how little malware lingers on iOS, I think it's safe to say the phone will last as long as you take care of it. 12. The camera is gorgeous, and the front-facing camera is one of the best I've seen to date. 13. The headphone jack works, the speakers work, the thumbprint lock works. 14. The phone is compatible with T-Mobile and AT&T. I'm really unsure about the others. 15. Don't go crazy over the negative reviews. I was starting to psyche myself out and almost didn't buy it, but i'm happy I did. Should anything not be up-to-par, I'm sure it's either fixable or returnable.
<<&&&&>>
I thought the phone was great until I started receiving phone calls. At first I thought it was the person on the line who's phone was messed up. After a few phone calls it was obvious the phone isn't working properly and all calls sound like the person is miles away, hard to hear them unless you put them on speaker phone. This was one of my fears of buying a "certified refurbished" product and unfortunately I was right.
<<&&&&>>
This came with the old battery. It has a battery max capacity of 80% which means the phone dies much faster than a phone with a new battery. I didn’t realize this until i noticed my phone was dying after about 8 hours after full charge overnight. By this time, i had this new phone set and didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending back and starting over. I think this seller counts on that. Now I have to set phone to low battery mode for it to last a day until I have the time to buy a new battery
<<&&&&>>
Pros Phone arrived in excellent condition no visible damage at all and properly unlocked I’m on cricket mobile all I had to do was insert sim and go. Cons After 3 days of use phone shut off and would not turn back on without being fully charged. Upon turning phone received an error notification that battery could not maintain peek performance Solution Contacted seller to no avail. Contacted Apple store and was informed based off of battery statistics that battery was faulty and needs to be replaced for 29.99 Scheduled maintenance for next week Results Will update after trip to Apple and verify true quality of the phone Overall Honestly it’s an inconvenience about the battery but even with the additional fee of replacing battery phone still comes in under 300 for a 64gb 6s I wish there was more clarity as to what certified refurbished means but all in all still satisfied with product though customer service may be a problem if your issue is major luckily my problem was only 30usd
<<&&&&>>
This phone was about half the price of a new IPhone SE, and replaced one that I bought that was run over by a semi truck (long story.) It included a wall charger and phone cord (it didn't include headphones), and a brand new looking IPhone. It only had 1 minor scratch on the back of the phone. However, since it is a refurbished item, I would think the quality can vary from device to device. WARNING: As it is a used item, I would recommend THOROUGHLY inspecting the item. Running screen checks, a battery capacity test, checking for water damage, checking the IMEI, looking to see if the seller has a high rating, the works. (if any of that sounds confusing, just look up those terms to check out what they mean. It takes about 15 minutes or less to perform your total check, but you save literally 100's of dollars. If that sounds like a lot of work, think of it as paying yourself $200 for 15 minutes of work! If you make $600 an hour, sure, buy a new phone. If not, there's no reason not to get this one!) If your phone passes your inspections, great! you just banked a few hundred dollars and have a shiny, new-to-you phone to use. In the unlikely event the IPhone ISN'T up to spec, simply contact the seller. You get 90 days to solve the problem, so you can return it if theres a problem a few months down the road. My experience was fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new phone
<<&&&&>>
I wish I could give it negative stars. I bought this pos phone for my boyfriend for Christmas. It came quickly and looked/worked nicely. Took it to Verizon to get it activated, apparently the phone we received is on a STOLEN PHONE LIST. I was so embarrassed. They asked me where we got the phone ect as though we were criminals. Thank you so much for ruining my Christmas present for my boyfriend, embarrassing me and wasting a lot of my time.
<<&&&&>>
The product came in a beaten up box, came locked AT&T, and still in an otter box case. It seems like it has been stolen, and immediately sold online. The phone isn't even reset or anything; personal phone calls, messages, photos and everything is still on the phone. Not sure exactly why products aren't being checked before they're sold. Definitely proved the first hand experience of buying an "unlocked refurbished phone" isn't trustable. Would not recommend taking the risk of buying something like this.

I wanted a second phone as a backup to my iPhone SE. So I decided to buy another one just like it. The SE is just the right size and performance for me, but sadly they have discontinued the model. I found the 64gb Space Gray Unlocked unit as a refurbished product at a good price from a seller called MyWit. It was a Prime item fulfilled by Amazon which I always look for. I had heard some horror stories about buying "refurbished" phones, so I contacted the seller with some questions. These were answered promptly and courteously, even though it was the weekend. Based on the contact with the seller, I made the purchase on a Sunday. My phone arrived on Tuesday afternoon, and I was surprised to find that it was in a sealed Verizon carton that said "Certified Pre-Owned". Everything inside looked new, and was wrapped in plastic and shipped with plastic film on it to protect the screen. I could not find a single mark on it that would indicate it was used. It came with a genuine Apple charging cord/power adapter. I had some concerns about whether it was really unlocked or not since it came from Verizon, and whether or not it would work on AT&T since my carrier is GSM and not CDMA. The seller had assured me the phone would work with either. I also wanted a second phone I could use when I go overseas. I'm a phone dummy. I know how to talk and text on them and not much more, but I followed the on-screen prompts on power up and simply placed the new phone next to my existing iPhone. In about 45 minutes the new phone had updated itself to the latest IOS version and transferred everything from my old phone, leaving all my things intact on my original phone. Very cool. Then the final test was to see if it was really unlocked. I put my AT&T SIM card from my original phone in the new phone, and at first it said "No Service" and I was disappointed. But in less than 30 seconds, the phone found service on AT&T and I was able to make a call. So, the phone really was unlocked, and worked on a GSM carrier. Excellent! So far I am incredibly pleased with how this worked out and with the seller. I paid $179.99 for the phone on Prime, which I think is incredibly fair given its condition and the fact that I paid more than $500 for the same phone just 2 years ago. If anything changes in further testing I'll update my review.

First,and important when you are considering a refurbished item, the vendor of this phone was Breed. The vendor is all-important, as they are sometimes the refurbisher, other times, they chose the refurbisher. The quality of the repairs and what sorts of phones are passed on to the customer depend on the refurbisher and the vendor. Please, folks, when you order through an Amazon vendor, mention the name of the vendor in your review. This will help other shoppers to identify which vendor you received good or bad products from, and who was responsible. We have had this refurbished 16 gb iPhone se for two weeks now, and it is an excellent replacement for my husband’s iPhone 5, which he had lost (the previous phone showed up behind the bed in a motel room we had stayed in, after nearly a week, so we were able to use the sim from our previous phone). The se model phone is a wonderful replacement, and was in like-new condition, with a Verizon sticker on the back. We took it to t-mobile to be sure it would update and transfer all settings etc from the previous phone, and the CSR could not have been more gracious and helpful. After two weeks, it is clear, the condition and performance of the phone are as good as the phone’s appearance. It arrived with a new, non-Apple charger and cable, but that is fine, we still have the charger from the previous phone, and have replaced our cables with lifetime warranty Anker cables (also available on Amazon - read the reviews). We are pleased with this phone, and would not hesitate to order refurbished equipment again from this vendor. I will mention, our iPhone 5 is still in great condition, after 4 years. It really does help to get a good case and screen covers for the phone, as they provide excellent protection from the inevitable bumps and falls.

Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  The phone worked fine until I had to charge it. Once it was fully charged, it started glitching out. It would crash, then cycle through the boot process indefinitely without success. Occasionally (after up to 1.5 hrs of cycling - see video for example), it would boot up and I would get it unlocked, only to have it crash as soon as it had to process a simple request (like receiving a text message or opening Settings). I couldn't connect it to my computer long enough to back up my data. I also couldn't get it to connect to iCloud to turn off Find My iPhone so I could erase it. I had to log into my iCloud from a friend's device and report the phone as missing/stolen and wipe it remotely so I could return it. If I hadn't been tech savvy enough to do that, I'm sure I would have had to return it with all my data still on it. I hate to say it, but it felt like an information hack/identity theft move to me. DON'T BUY REFURBISHED FROM THIRD PARTY SELLERS --- EVEN IF THEY'RE BACKED BY AMAZON. (Note: I purchased it from Platinum Deals - have reviewed seller as well.)
<<&&&&>>
Apple has the badest Support I have ever seen! This device is locked and I have the proof that I bought it here at Amazon with an invoice. I can't use this phone because APPLE didn't allow it! How is that? And they don't care about if you have a proof that this is my property. Be careful when you buying Apple products, Apple still owns ist and apple is only alowing you to use theri stuff. They won't help even you have a proof that this is your property! No contact by support phone and the mail support takes 7 to 10 day each answer!
<<&&&&>>
First the phone was not unlocked, as advertised, which meant I had to pay to unlock it. Then it started having some issues to various programs, which would not open nor would it let me delete them to see if I could reinstall them (like skype, chrome, safari, and others). Then it would not give me an option to answer calls (phone, skype, or whatsapp). Even after trying to reset it (in full, network settings, phone settings) it would work for a bit and then do that again. In short, now I tried to factory reset after saving what I had on it, and now it doesn't even want to let me access it. In short, now I have to go to a technical service provider to see if it even is going to work at all.

Solid phone with minor scratched on the back but I can deal with that. Why I gave it two stars was that Touch ID doesn't work. I don't know if they replaced the home button that wasn't the original from the phone I got, but it is such a buzz kill. I emailed the seller and hopefully there can we a way to fix this. if there is I'll change my review to five stars. But until then I'm sticking to two. If you want a FULLY functioning iPhone you should probably buy one from a different seller. Just my two cents. UPDATE #1: I sent out an email to Blutek and I did not get a reply. Even worse, the speaker blasts static for a brief moment when I raise the volume. It only happened once and hopefully it doesn't happen again. UPDATE #2: Called the original seller and no one picked up. Emailed the seller and didn't get a reply also so I turned to Amazon for help. Got a partial refund ($44) so I can fix it from an apple store. It will cover half but at this point but I just want a "fully" functioning iPhone at this point so I pay the rest out of pocket. Not buying from Bluetek again.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived with a number of damages: a crack in the screen, the top right corner damaged and separating from the body, and dents and scrapes on all corners. Completely unacceptable "refurbished" condition.
<<&&&&>>
I Bought It Today ( February 28th , 2017 ) got it ON TIME ! switch it to metroPCS with no problem ( 5 star Rating )
<<&&&&>>
Horrible phone.couldn't connect to any network. Even tried to switch. Tried multiple SIM cards and nothing worked. Dissapointed. Paid a lot of money. Thankfully sending it back shouldn't be a problem.
<<&&&&>>
Bought two, one for my girlfriend and one for me. Both phones were in perfect conditions. They actually looked new. Had zero issues setting them up or getting them to connect thru T-Mobile's network. I've had the phone two weeks now and I've had no problems whatsoever.
<<&&&&>>
Came right on time. Phone was in perfect condition. Came with charger, SIM card opener and screen protector. Still is a great phone till this day.
<<&&&&>>
Receive it in a timely fashion, has worked great, no scratches whatsoever, and is all like new! I was able to use the company I wanted with great service, and no hassle for the price. It comes with just a charger (generic) approved good, no earphones. Was worth the price!
<<&&&&>>
I pushed my boyfriend in the pool with his phone in his pocket so I bought him this as a replacement and so far so good! He’s had it for a week and said the battery is great and there were no scratches or anything. He put his SIM card in the phone and it worked just fine! I don’t think I’ll ever buy a brand new phone again! Highly recommended
<<&&&&>>
Very disappointed!! Received phone still locked and unable to activate it with my carrier!
<<&&&&>>
Phone seemed brand new! I love this phone no issue very smooth and no marks.. it’s like it’s brand new totally worth the money I’m loving every minute of this phone everything works well! Omg ❤️

Before I ordered this phone I read all the reviews and did a ton of research because I was worried that the phone would be broken in some way. It is now 4 month since I got the phone and it works perfectly. It is in almost perfect condition (few scratches ans dents) I have no problem so don't worry about it coming in bad condition like i did.
<<&&&&>>
Got this for my 9 year old son while away on vacation and we've been able to keep in touch the whole time. He loves his phone and the large screen makes it great for gaming too.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is great but the battery life sucks compared to my other iPhone 6splus which lasted longer and all day.
<<&&&&>>
Beware of VIP Outlet. They do not pick up phone calls or answer emails. Their phone don’t work and the display looks like a fake replacement part causing it to not register to tap. Also the included charger is a knockoff / non-genuine copy.
<<&&&&>>
Bought it earlier this year it’s working fine camera is lovely better than expected. I’ll give another review update by January. Hopefully it last as long
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in great quality , but when I got my sims & went to my carrier they said my signal chip in the phone is broken , so I’m pissed & want a new phone or my money back because everything should work when you purchase an item.
<<&&&&>>
Unless told it is a brand new phone out of the package. I am so happy to have it for my wife on valentine's day.Two days passed and She has been using it without a single frawn. Thanks Amazon for their excellent logistics and Breed to have the product ready for her.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in EXCELLENT condition, I can’t believe is not brand new, because it definitely looks and feel like it! Battery life and performance far beyond expectations. Excellent buy, I would buy from the again anytime! 10/10 I am extremely happy with the phone!
<<&&&&>>
This item is 100% real. I got mine yesterday and it's perfectly ok. Just like new,when I input my SIM card here in Nigeria it works OK. I don't know why this item is having negative view,to me it's jes too okay for the price just like new
<<&&&&>>
Arrived ontime,it’s just like what I’ve expected and I was surprised it came with a screen protector on and a case. Think I shiould get an earphone too.
<<&&&&>>
Just got it today has a minor scratch on the side but the phone functions perfectly this doesn’t come with a screen protector or anything but the packaging was very secure. I would recommend this phone had no problem with activating it through Metro Pcs
<<&&&&>>
The I phone 6S plus that I received was perfect. Could not ask for anything better. Price, delivery, and phone were awesome. If they had six stars I would give that to them
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the phone and it came on time. Nicely packaged. Battery life goes up to 100%. No scratches or anything like that on it. Sound works great and had no problem activating my old SIM card from my other phone. If you don’t like the charger they give you , you can use your old iPhone charger if you want. So far so good.
<<&&&&>>
Defective camara
<<&&&&>>
👍🏽
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had my phone for almost a year now and it doesn’t give me any problems.
<<&&&&>>
Phone didn’t have a great battery. Had several glitches with this phone
<<&&&&>>
I'm sorry it was the phone not case it freezes up continually,paid over $200 for it ,not satisfied
<<&&&&>>
Excelent product!!! I give 5 star, the phone was in EXCELENT conditions, NEW!! So far so god..
<<&&&&>>
This phone came in carrier unlocked as promised. It looks brand new and works like new. The phone came pre-installed with IOS9. The old phone was backed up to iTunes with a password to preserve wifi passwords, keychain etc. No issues getting it upgraded to IOS10. Once the new phone was updated to IOS 10 the backup was restored and the sim chip transferred. The phone immediately went out to the network and was working within a few minutes. No need to call the carrier. The phone now functions perfectly on Verizon Wireless.
<<&&&&>>
I was very skeptical about ordering pre-owned products online, first time ever, always purchased new. Damn near flawless, actually I still can't see a nick or a scratch anywhere, impressive! As sub-par customer service has become the norm, at least in these price ranges, these guys delivered, I actually feel like I got my money's worth. I'm all the way up!..
<<&&&&>>
EXCELLENT
<<&&&&>>
The speaker on the phone I ordered did not work
<<&&&&>>
Phone was beautiful when it arrived and appeared to be brand new. HOWEVER, the phone would NOT charge and when taken to Verizon to activate, the phone would continuously turn off without warning!!!! Not happy!!!
<<&&&&>>
This phone was a gift for my daughter 14th birthday. This phone is wonderful, tge battery life is good and she has not had any problems with the phone. The phone was in excellent condition and was easy to activate witg her Metro pcs account. I highly recommend you order from them.
<<&&&&>>
This was a very satisfying purchase. The product was in perfect physical condition and works superbly . I would certainly recommend this supplier.
<<&&&&>>
Buena relación costo/beneficio
<<&&&&>>
Battery life could be better but it’s a used older phone
<<&&&&>>
Nice, clean, as advertised and delivered within 24 hours. Zero issues.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is in perfect condition, absolutely NO complaints!!! Thank Goodness! Safe to buy from Kanga Supply!!
<<&&&&>>
This phone only lasted me about 4 months then it started doing some reboot thing and I had to replace it. But I just got a store brought phone instead.
<<&&&&>>
Just buy the iPhone
<<&&&&>>

I love the white version of the iPhone. This works great!
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone. Just received and looks brand new. Not a sIngle mark. Worth to the price. I’m yet to use it but feels good to see the phone starts nice. No one can find it’s refurbished until you tell. I’m happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
New
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone was immaculate. No scuffs and truly GSM unlocked. Although I was skeptical at first from reading everyone's reviews I took a chance. The seller I purchased the phone from was Chubbiestech and they definitely delivered.
<<&&&&>>
This refurbished phone is as good as new- why spend additional bucks on new? Fully satisfied and happy to see the condition and performance of this phone and recommend Chubbiestech - thumbs-up.
<<&&&&>>
I love the phone so far. The only issue is that my SIM card won’t work but I’m not sure if that’s becasue of the phone. It’s in great condition and I even reviewed a very nice phone case along with the phone and charger. It shipped very fast. It came in about 3 days which is amazing.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is everything and more I could have asked for.
<<&&&&>>
Se descarga rápido

I, got a iPhone 6s plus for my daughter for Christmas. It was in great shape.I got her a iPhone 5s last year fo r Christmas from deal Fisher and that phone was great as well.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came just as expected! Works AMAZING , using it right now was kinda iffy about the product the way the packaging came, but it was worth it at the end of the day. Would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
<<&&&&>>
The touch on this phone wasn’t working well . But due to the fact that I had sent it to my daughter in Jamaica I did not return it so I had to pay money to get it changed.
<<&&&&>>
I realky like this purchase!
<<&&&&>>
Oh No ! A Christmas Gift disaster. iPhone could’nt be activated . Took it to Boost Mobile, and THE APPLE STORE, WHO SAID THEY HAD NO CLUE. SAD TEENAGER, SAD CHRISTMAS, SENT IT BACK.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone. Looks brand new. Glad I made the buy.
<<&&&&>>
The phone works great! Loving it
<<&&&&>>
In the publication says iphone 6s plus 64 gb, and the package was an iphone 6s plus 16 gb, the seller responds that it was for 16 gb, but im not agree because the ad says something different , the phone arrives ok , perfect conditions
<<&&&&>>
My only issue is with the battery life and the shakey camera
<<&&&&>>
This item was a good product the phone had nothing wrong with it! I'm gonna buy another for my daugther.
<<&&&&>>
Poca vida útil de batería
<<&&&&>>
This phone gets overheated in couple of minutes. I could not talk more than 15 minutes by audio or video call as the phone gets extremely hot.
<<&&&&>>
The device is like new, unlocked and its battery works perfectly. Very satisfied with this seller.
<<&&&&>>
The best purchase I made in a long time my phone works good and case I got with it is live if u looking for a iPhone order here u will not be disappointed
<<&&&&>>

My iphone 6 s plus just stop working and the battery is not charging! I purchased on march 4th 2018!!
<<&&&&>>
Received phone fast was very happy was for my kid for Christmas. Im a single mom of 4 kids. I worked so hard to get this for my kid. I was pulling 65 hour work weeks on 2 jobs killing myself to give my kids a good Christmas. Went to have phone activated at metro pcs and they sad it is black listed. The number on the phone goes on this list when it is stolen. They sold me a stolen phone!!! And when i called amazon they were wonderful in assisting me. The company only has an email as a contact. Its now jan 25th and i still have no phone for my kid.
<<&&&&>>
Thank

Works fine, only phone and charger. Yet I feel scammed as they decreased price by 20$ just after my purchase!
<<&&&&>>
Me agrado mucho

Beautiful iPhone 6S Plus. Looks like new. My carrier is t-Mobile, and I had it running in five minutes. Price was best anywhere, and seller was very good communicator.
<<&&&&>>
Alright phone looked perfect I was very excited but this phone is blacklisted and cannot be activated this company will get in a lot of trouble for illegally selling these stolen/lost phone's.
<<&&&&>>
All good!
<<&&&&>>
I was so so bervous to buy a refurbished iPhone on amazon, but I just didn't have the $600+ to get a new one, and I don't like the idea of having to pay monthly for it. I bought the 6s Plus and it exceeded my expectation. It looks brand new and works perfectly!!! I'm so happy!
<<&&&&>>
Phone didn't even work wouldn't turn on cause it needed to be restored but wasn't able to restore either. I tried on 3 different computers. Complete waste of time . Had to pay to send it back in hope I can get a refund. Will update my review of they actually follow through with my refund for their scrappy phone. Oh & they also do not answer phone calls or let you leave voicemails if there is something wrong with the phone, so there's that. Was a hassle to even get my label for a refund.
<<&&&&>>
I was very nervous about buying a refurbished IPhone especially seeing the few negative reviews, but I took the leap of faith and went ahead and ordered it anyways. I ordered it with the 1 day shipping and as expected was here on time. To my expectations it was pretty much flawless. Also 16 GB and unlocked as described. Was an easy setup. Popped in my Cricket sims and connected right away. I'm very pleased with the purchase and will definitely do business again!
<<&&&&>>
Major button, not too reliable in choosing the icons or the ISIS.
<<&&&&>>
Not unlocked, very bad buy
<<&&&&>>
Amazing
<<&&&&>>
Loving my phone!!! I wa very skeptical after reading a couple of reviews but I took the chance and in so glad I did! Feels like new and works great!
<<&&&&>>
Was really unsure about buying this phone (switching from a galaxy to iPhone.) Well I finally broke down and bought this and I'm glad I did. I've had it for about a week, had no problem activating it or using it. Looks brand new and works like it is too. Definitely 5 stars for this phone. Great phone for a great price
<<&&&&>>
Awesome experience Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Out going voice can't lissen nothing zero voice but they send me like this phone
<<&&&&>>
Not like new condition. 7/10 at best.
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Really disappointed I found scratches on the edges of the phone I paid full price I at least expect to get a phone with out scratches
<<&&&&>>
Phone is amazing especially its operating system and accessibility and 3D Touch features has made the 6s plus unique from any other phones. I loved it but since it isn't open source it's less likely to enjoy as much as android while surfing the web and downloading songs even from online market.
<<&&&&>>
My phone has stopped working with my carrier since this past weekend completely!!!!! However this has been a problem in the last 2 months on and off. I've tried using other sim cards and it's not working either. The phone is not reading the sim cards and it's impossible to have spent almost $300 for this not to work. It's been a NIGHTMARE getting anything done with this phone or even just getting an uber. I NEED A REFUND!!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
It’s great. It came like new, would recommend this
<<&&&&>>
Great quality, nice packaging
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my son's birthday I had to turn his phone off to activate this Apple phone to keep his number and it doesn't work he can hear through the ears the touch screen is messed up everything is messed up on this phone this is ridiculous I can't believe it 13 year old child to see tears in his eyes is unbelievable never again never again and I'm a Prime member I can't believe this then they want me to send the phone back I paid to activate his phone is it's almost close to the refund that makes no sense unbelievable that's all I got to say never again and I love shopping with Amazon but this right here sour taste in my mouth
<<&&&&>>
This will be the 6th "Certified Refurbished" iPhone I have purchased from Amazon. Just like all the others, it looks 'Brand New" - not a scratch. IMEI check comes back clean. The accessories are not genuine OEM Apple, but the phone is perfect. An Unlocked GSM phone, just charge it up, Insert your sim card and get some WiFi and update the software. If you are replacing an older iPhone, back up your old phone first. Then plug this new phone into your computer and "Restore From Back-up"
<<&&&&>>
I gave a 3 star rating because it is an iPhone however the touch calibration goes out a lot and callers at time can't hear you talking also will not send pictures to other smartphone users only those with iPhones.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent arrival and phone is in perfect and as-new condition! Comes in nice hard plastic case that includes a charger and push pin. I was so impressed that I bought another one for my father the next day. Second phone was just as beautiful and new condition. Perfect price as well!
<<&&&&>>
At first, battery was getting discharged very quickly. Contacted seller, seller gave $29 +Tax, a refund for battery, it was awesome. Then after four weeks, the phone screen will turn black and stay that way for hours and days. I tried everything on the internet. At the end I had to take to Apple center it cost me $180 to replace the screen. Not a good experience.
<<&&&&>>
I always read the bad reviews first- don’t know why. They definitely made me a bit hesitant but after realizing buying a used phone is always a gamble, I decided to go with amazon instead of Craigslist or whatever. For me personally it turned out great! The phone was in excellent condition, looked brand new. It came in a generic box along with a generic cable, screen protector, and a case. I had no issues setting up the phone and so far it’s been working great. Good purchase.
<<&&&&>>
In perfect condition and with 90% of battery capacity
<<&&&&>>
Quality product. I recommended. Great condition.
<<&&&&>>
Incredible. Not one scratch
<<&&&&>>
Great product and works just like a new one!
<<&&&&>>
Over all good phone lil scratch but no big deal
<<&&&&>>
Good buy
<<&&&&>>
Got my loved it looks brand new only thing charger did not work had to buy another charger. But phone is perfect .
<<&&&&>>
I've never had an issue with a CR device, whether it's been a tablet or phone, and I love it! Definitely worth the price, if you don't want to pay $600+ for a 6s Plus iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
Had a virus of some sort, doesn’t work and calls people on its own. Really needed this for work and it’s cost us a lot more than just the cost of the phone
<<&&&&>>
No problem with phone
<<&&&&>>
I am very pleased with the seller: Chubbiestech I bought two phones and they are nothing from new😍
<<&&&&>>
perfect condition. was compatible with metropcs
<<&&&&>>
No problems. My daughter loves it.
<<&&&&>>
I like
<<&&&&>>
For my first iPhone purchase I am very satisfied
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks brand new and work great!
<<&&&&>>
This phone was great until i went to get it cut on and they said it wouldn't support my carrier when in the description it CLEARLY said it was unlocked... now i have to return it and struggle to find ANOTHER phone !!!
<<&&&&>>
Really good place to get this phone really good company. Phone came in and everything looked amazing and works amazing to
<<&&&&>>
The camera didn't work, so I had to send it back right away.
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new, the battery is ok. I recommend it.
<<&&&&>>
Was nervous buying this porduct, once received I was impressed. Phone is like brand new!
<<&&&&>>
Excelente todo correctic
<<&&&&>>
Great for the price
<<&&&&>>
When I read the details of the phone it was suppose to be brand new but this wasn't the case.The bottom of the phone was dirty with wear and tear marks around the edges they could at least clean it before selling. I'm so disappointed especially with the diet in the speaker area and headphone areas. Forget the lie of being brand new. It was used and I'm upset!!
<<&&&&>>
It was exactly as advertised! Popped in my SIM card, worked perfectly. Added bonus was the phone came with a pre-installed screen protector.
<<&&&&>>
This phone battery dies very fast! I full charged the phone and put it down for about 2hrs without using it and the phone was on 2%
<<&&&&>>
I bought one and then decided to buy another. The first one was perfect. No scratches and looked brand new. But the second one had scratches on the screen , not too noticeable when turned on. Overall, i would recommend this product.
<<&&&&>>
Battery was dead when I got it.. I charged it to full capacity and then unplugged the charger and the battery went down to zero in a few minutes. Took it to the Apple store and they said the battery was defective and charged me 49 dollars to replace it.
<<&&&&>>
Product works great! Nothing bad about this product. I had to purchase a SIM cards separately and didn't know until a day after phone arrived. This wasn't the companies fault, it was my mobile provider. Once I got the SIM cards and took it to Boost, works great. Make sure you get a SIM card kit if you have Boost especially!!
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone and I was so nervous to buy and unlocked phone online, but it was worth it. It works like a charm and I had no issues with getting it to work at all.
<<&&&&>>
The phone didn’t come with ear pods but that’s ok and it has a little bit of scratches but it not a big deal I highly recommend buying it.
<<&&&&>>
It functioned in terms of making calls, but ever since I bought it, it has had issues. When I first got it, I found that when using the microphone when taking videos, there was a loud static sound that would go into the recording. I took it to the apple store but the phone is obviously no longer under warranty and they wanted several hundred to fix it. Then the battery started having problems, with randomly shutting down or dying quickly. Currently I have the phone, about a year later, and it says the battery is completely dead while it is charged.
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked perfectly
<<&&&&>>
The good replacement iPhone was provided by CPOCell. The previous bad iPhone was provided by Spartan Technologies. Amazon shouldn't allow Spartan and apparently lots of other companies to advertise junk as being renewed. It all depends on the company that renews (or not) the iPhone. So do some research before you buy and save some grief.
<<&&&&>>
Excelent...I will buy again from this seller.
<<&&&&>>
The phone works and looks like it is brand new. I t even came a week earlier than originally stated.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent phone...
<<&&&&>>
I have never write an review first time but this item is really good no complaints...
<<&&&&>>
Good phone but don't buy. The people who had before locked the phone I can't get service or do anything on here besides wifi which depeats the purpose of buying, I'll be using this on wifi but wish service could work
<<&&&&>>
Good and work well
<<&&&&>>
Phone was great till the battery started to die after 7 days and phone stated "battery health is significantly degraded". amazons solution was for me to just return my only source of mobile communication so that's very convenient but at least they took at back no questions.
<<&&&&>>
Bought it for my daughter. She loves it. Easy to switch sim card.
<<&&&&>>
I liked the phone, no scratch, no nothing but i ordered a 64GB and they sent a 32gb one
<<&&&&>>
👌
<<&&&&>>
Looks and works great
<<&&&&>>
I disliked it cause I bought it in March 2019& then my screen went black in June 2019. Very dissatisfied
<<&&&&>>
The back off the camera is scratched.quality off the brightness is poor
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great and looks brand new.
<<&&&&>>
gracias totales se pasaron

Used phone at a good price, needed a replacement for my phone without breaking the bank.

The phone DOES NOT CHARGE ANYMORE. I got this today and had my accounts transferred from my iPad . Then I had a SIM card installed. The problem is that the phone stopped charging. I had the people at Verizon look at it and now no one answers the phone or returns my email. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!
<<&&&&>>
I was a little scared a first to order . but I'm glad I did my son love it..and I will be ordering 2 more .
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with my phone. As good as new, not even a scratche. I could not believe it for 1/3 of the original price! Ordering another one for my son xmas present.
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  When the phone arrived I plugged it up and waited for it to charge for a while-it got to and stayed between 25 and 26 percent. I went through the initial set up, updated it to the IOS 11. Then things went downhill from there-It started freezing-I erased it and started over got through the passcode set up and that’s were it began shutting down and restarting, shutting down and restarting. Since I reset it to factory settings Find My IPhone was disabled therefore I cannot wipe it. I have a feeling I’m going to get the run around about my refund because my passcode is in the phone. I’ve been ripped off basically.
<<&&&&>>
We contacted this company several times since we purchased an iPhone from them, both during the 90 day window, and outside of it. Their service has been absolutely useless. In my latest exchange with the company, I asked that they please provide an unlock code, as the phone is apparently tethered to AT&T's network's, and AT&T advised us to ask the seller for a code. We somehow missed that fact when we purchased the phone, unfortunately. The seller's flat response now is that they refuse to provide any answers to questions, or any support outside the "90 day window". We have purchased many other products through Amazon in the past, and had companies even replace defective products that were well outside 90 days - some even committing that they provide support for the life of the product! Amazon is a wonderful forum, and we are grateful for their platform - but this is a bad seller. I recommend steering clear of them and purchasing your iPhones through a different vendor on the Amazon platform. With regard to this product which we purchased through this vendor, we have now been advised by AT*T that the IMEI number is not even associated with an AT&T phone; although they advertise it is tethered to the AT&T network. We have never been able to activate this phone through any vendor since we purchased it last October, but have only been able to use it on WiFi networks using Google hangouts. We are basically the proud owners of a $175 paperweight, and the seller could care less. What a disappointing Amazon experience.
<<&&&&>>
This phone worked great at first. I purchased this phone on September 7th and I just contacted the seller today, November 19th because the phone is breaking. The silence button is broken and will turn off/on without even flipping it. Brushing against it causes the volume to either go up or down. The audio jack works to an extent but if I turn the earbuds/aux it will get quiet or with earbuds, if I turn it on accident it sets the volume all the way up. Both the ringer and the earbud problem have gotten me in trouble in class multiple times. The battery went from lasting three days without being recharged to dying in a matter of hours. I was so excited for this phone and love it so much but these problems are going to get me in trouble with my dad since he spent so much on it. Thank god for that 90 day limited warrenty. On the upside it came with a screen protector and a phone charger.
<<&&&&>>
I have only been using my phone for 2 days but so far I like it. The talk to text is the best verses the talk to text on my android phone where I have to talk really slow. Even talking slow with the Google talk to text it still doesn't get the words right but, on my iPhone talk to text works great. I don't have to talk super slow and it gets everything I say 100% right. However, my phone will not hold it's charge. The first day I started using the phone I had to charge it twice and still by the time I went to bed at midnight I ended up having to put it back on the charger and already today 2 times so far and counting. So when buying this phone just be cautious on the battery life.
<<&&&&>>
It was actually in perfect condition and I was worried about it because of some of the comments after it was to late to cancel
<<&&&&>>
Got this for my daughter to replace her iphone 4. I've gotten phones from amazon sellers before and had bad luck so I was a little wary. This one has been a dream. Easy to setup and absolutely no issues. Buy with confidence!
<<&&&&>>
Originally I thought this was a great purchase. However almost exactly four months to the day the phone started shutting off randomly, battery would drastically drop when fully charged and randomly reboot. Of course the warranty is only for 90 days. Now I fear I wasted my money when I could have bought a brand new phone for a little more. When you pay this much it should last longer than four months.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this before I read the reviews and was nervous about the quality. But the Iphone 6s looks like new and the transfer from my old Iphone 5 went smoothly. Everything seems to work like it should and I'm very happy with my purchase . Fast shipping - and I would buy again from this seller! THANKS
<<&&&&>>
Fully unlocked. Everything has worked so far. The only negative I've encountered was the battery does seem to die quicker than previous phones.
<<&&&&>>
This was offered as an AT&T phone. That’s why I purchased it. It is not. It is a CSpire phone. Never heard of them. Can’t use the phone with AT&T. Spent hours on the phone with AT&T, and Apple. They couldn’t help me. CSpire didn’t lift a finger to help. Thanks for nothing, reseller.
<<&&&&>>
It is an iphone - working just fine - not much more to say...
<<&&&&>>
So far so good with the iPhone. The condition was good, working good so far. Only issue is that it must’ve been from Japan or China since we can’t get the shutter sound off on the camera. Other than that it’s been a couple days and no issues.
<<&&&&>>
Product looked like new and was as expected
<<&&&&>>
No me agrado porque venden cosas desbloqueadas y no están liberadas estan con deudas hacen perderse tiempo y es molesto pensé que eran más profesionales y vendían productos exactamente como dice en la descripción yo pague lo de aduanas y eso nadie me lo va a delvover
<<&&&&>>
Que vendedor más mentiroso dice que están desbloqueado y no vienen desbloqueados eso se llama fraude una vergüenza
<<&&&&>>
This is exactly what I needed, just like new.
<<&&&&>>
I have the gold iPhone 6s it works great no problems it looks brand new if I didn’t know it was refurbished I never would have known. I definitely suggest this product to anyone who is looking for a good phone for everyday use. My battery still works great it lasts a very long time.
<<&&&&>>
Very pleased with this purchase. Works like new
<<&&&&>>
I received this phone , would not hold a charge. I had to order a new battery. The quality of the phone is not what I expected. I ordered this phone from your website. Ordered the battery from your site . I think it will be the last . Thank you
<<&&&&>>
It has been a very good purchase. Looked like. New and apparently has a new battery.
<<&&&&>>
Had to replace a broken phone. Received this one quickly and it appears to be in good working order.
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks great. Works great. Relieve to have a non-cracked screen. My only issue is that the battery drains quicker. Other than that it’s totally worth the buy.
<<&&&&>>
iPhone came in and looked brand new, not a scratch or mark on it, I’m very happy with it, price was great too. All I had to do was turn the phone on, put my SIM card in from my old iPhone phone and follow setup instructions.
<<&&&&>>
These phones are like new! Perfect for teens!! Thank you!!!
<<&&&&>>
Phone is ok for the money just the replacement screen does not get as bright as the original Iphone screen.
<<&&&&>>
great phone
<<&&&&>>
This is a really nice phone however I believe I will have to replace the battery but besides that everything is great
<<&&&&>>
They sold me a locked phone!
<<&&&&>>
I wanted IMessage for as cheap as I could get it
<<&&&&>>
Good product!
<<&&&&>>
have had the phone for 2 months and the middle home circle button is defective and doesn't work May I return please?
<<&&&&>>
Great phone!
<<&&&&>>
I like it but how can we use it but it's a locked phone
<<&&&&>>
So far so good just received it
<<&&&&>>
Great price ! And the phone came in on time. No scratches or anything perfect condition!
<<&&&&>>
Came on time and was what we expected!
<<&&&&>>
No trae audifonos
<<&&&&>>
Not happy at all!! Just got this phone 1 day ago and the battery is trash!
<<&&&&>>
very fast delivery and works as stated. AT&T service needed.
<<&&&&>>
No complaints, phone arrived on time and was as advertised
<<&&&&>>
I like everything about the phone I really appreciate it
<<&&&&>>
I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews for this phone based on issues with the seller. Granted, some of those reviews say it took a few weeks for the problems to appear so I’ll edit this if that happens, but wow was I happy with what I got. Not only did it come with a charger (there’s some debate on that in other reviews), but it even had a clear bumper case. That was neither expected nor necessary but I appreciated it (I bought a Unicorn Beetle case which I have used and loved before on other phones). There wasn’t a scratch on this phone and it started working right away for me. The battery seems to be holding up fine. All in all I’d say this seems like a steal. If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I’ll update this. UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone 7 I purchased was "certified refurbished" and labeled as "new" quality but doesn't work. The phone looks great, but when I first turned it on it was in a restart loop. This was a bad sign to begin with, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and connected it to my computer. When I finally got it to restore to factory settings, the screen started glitching to the point where there was nothing to stop it, and if it did get to the startup screen, it was non-responsive. The shipping took a few days, but at least it came when scheduled. I have been unable to make contact with the company, but I will update my review if they are able to fix the issue and if I receive a working phone. Update: Ended up returning the phone and purchasing elsewhere. The company was cooperative with the return. Of course this could have been a one-off issue
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as described. Unlocked . Worked immediately in excellent condition. Battery is in prime condition. I believe the people that are reading negative reviews are using iPhones that they received from these guys to try and put their SIM card from Verizon or Sprint which are still pulling from cdma based networks which is why it's not going to work The phone is GSM unlocked not factory unlocked there is a big difference the sooner people educate themselves on the difference the better off our society will be
<<&&&&>>
I am very disappointed!!! I've ordered and had success with a previous refurbished phone. However, this iphone 7 with 128 GB was stated as unlocked, which it was. It was stated that it was Verizon compatible. It clearly was not. The Verizon techs stated that the system on this phone had to be from another country whose systems are totally incompatible with US carrier systems. We spent hours at the Verizon store just to have to purchase a brand new phone from them. I watched. They tried everything to make my refurbished work. Very frustrated and never doing this refurbished phone thing again.
<<&&&&>>
It’s a scam!! The screen doesn’t respond properly so and the battery dies within one hour. I highly recommend that NO ONE gets this product and it should be taken off Amazon immediately. I don’t want everyone to make the same mistake I did by buying this horrible product.
<<&&&&>>
Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone. I've had it for a month and the screen has started going black every few minutes, and sometimes it freaks out and tells me I have no way to connect to wifi or cell coverage (despite being somewhere with wifi and usually 4G). I'm returning before the problems escalate. Note- it doesn't come with a charger or with headphones.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is not Verizon compatible! The side of the package says UNLK/T-Mobile. Tried to activate it anyways and it couldn't be.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone based off carrier compatibility. It is clearly stated that this phone will work with Verizon Wireless. After 2 hours on the phone with tech support, they finally let us know that this (t-moble) phone will only work on the (t-mobile and ATT) networks.
<<&&&&>>
This arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it. It came much earlier than expected which is amazing! I see many reviews that say it isn't compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when I activated it with Sprint. And despite its price it works great! It's not slow and the battery doesn't drain too quickly or anything like that. I, honestly, highly recommend this product!! 5 Stars all the way!
<<&&&&>>
Before I even turned it on I tried to put it in a case and saw that the screen had popped out of the casing. The phone wouldn't turn on so I tried to charge it. The cable was loose in the charging port and the phone never powered on!!
<<&&&&>>
There a scratch in the glass touch
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with my purchase
<<&&&&>>
It was great it’s just the packaging but out of it all very nice.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone arrived with minor scratches on the back, but other than that the phone works perfectly fine! I have been using it for awhile and haven't noticed any complications with the battery or anything yet. I am very happy with this purchase!
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this phone, and it came with a supervision profile installed, which allows someone to monitor my internet usage and location. The top of the phone says “This device is supervised by TEST”. This is not acceptable. If this cannot be removed, I will need to return the phone.
<<&&&&>>
I thought I was saving myself time and money buying this refurbished phone. Worked fine for two weeks but started failing. Took it to Apple and it was unrepairable. They think it was failing bc it was refurbished with non-apple parts. I had a flight to catch the next day and Needed my phone. Decided to do what I should have done in the first place and trade in for a brand new phone. Not worth the hassle and headache.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my network VERIZON and worked flawlessly, BUT you have to have a sim card, if you dont, you have to go to verizon and have them get you one. I saw A REVIEW on here that says not compatible with VERIZON, this is untrue, because she said she was on the phone with verizon for an hour. I know that shes wrong because there is no need to call verizon, just take the sim out of your current phone and pop into the iphone, and boom done. If you dont have a sim, you have to GO to a verizon store, they CANT give you a sim over the PHONE. ALSO here is another tid-bit of information for you - Yes it does, I myself have verizon, and it indeed works. Also, just for your information, 'Unlocked" means it will work with any carrier. Also another tid-bit of information, any iphone after the 5s, I mean any iphone after 5s, on any carrier can be taken to any other carrier. For example, lets say I have a Sprint unlimited plan with an iphone 6s Plus, that iPhone 6s Plus can be taken to any other carrier and activated (because its an iphone thats later than the iPhone 5s). Oh and also of course assuming that the phone has been paid in full, because if you do one of those payment plans with the iPhone where they take the cost of the iPhone and divide it by 24 and then add that to your monthly bill, that iPhone cant be taken to any other carrier (even if after 5s) until its been 2 years and been paid on monthly or its paid in full at the time you want to take it to another carrier. Now back to my example, and assuming the iPhone is paid for in full, and lets say I am selling my sprint phone to you (and you have verizon) I would sell the phone to you, and you would then go to sprint yourself, and say i just bought this phone, its been paid in full, and i need you to "release it from sprint" so i can take it to my network verizon. And then badda bing your home free, and after that, that iPhone is now "unlocked" and can take to your carrier, and then if you were going to sell the phone again down the road, whoever you sell it to would not have to do what you did, because once you did it, the phone became "unlocked". So if its an iPhone 5s and later, it is unlocked and can be taken to any carrier no matter what carrier it was used on prior. The days that you had to search for a phone that was on the same network as your own, are gone.
<<&&&&>>
Just spent an hour on phone with Verizon and they said this phone will NOT work on Verizon. Don't buy if you are on Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone back in March after my old one was stolen. It was decently priced and I was desperate. It worked great, looked and felt brand new, I had no problems connecting it with my carrier! After about 6 months, it started to freak out and restart all the time. My apple ID no longer would work so my imessages were turned off, I couldn’t facetime. It was a nightmare! Also when I would barely put it down on a table the screen would freak out and it was restart again. Sometimes I would have to forse wake it. The people at the Apple Store told me that there was something wrong with the hardware and that many certified refurbished phones have had their hardware touched or messed with during the refurbishing process. I ended up getting a brand new phone about 8 months after I purchased this one. Bottom line, don’t buy this phone if you want it for a long period of time it will have so many problems in the long run and it’s more worth it to spend the money on a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
So far, this phone has been working as expected. No disappointments
<<&&&&>>
Seems to work well. I’m enjoying a battery that lasts overnight and apps that don’t crash every time they open (like my poor older phone). Overall, seems to be a good product so far. A couple minor dings on the corners of the phone but it came with a screen protector which is great. My only other complaint is that it has trouble with my parents’ WiFi, but they don’t have the fastest internet to start. And of course I hate that it doesn’t have a headphone jack (but that’s an iPhone thing not an amazon thing).
<<&&&&>>
The phone worked ok for a while, now it has interference and cutting out issues when talking on it. Texting worked fine at first but some seemed to be delayed how but I'm not sure if that's the phone or the provider.
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone quickly and it was in good condition, looks like a brand new phone and worked perfect. About a week maybe two weeks later the microphone completely stopped working; couldn’t talk on the phone or speak to text or record videos. Tried everything to fix it myself, eventually calling Apple for them to tell me that this is a common issue with the iPhone 7 and the only way to fix it was to make an appointment at the Apple Store which for me is almost 2 hours away. So just beware of any iPhone 7, not from this seller in particular but I would just get a 6S they are just as good actually better because I’ve had no issues with my 6.
<<&&&&>>
The phone it’s selfnis alright, the charger I received with the phone has stopped working all together. I take good care of my things so I know it’s not me. I received my phone at the end of October. It is December 6th and my charger isn’t working. That is a problem. Now I can’t even charge my phone anymore.
<<&&&&>>
WE purchased this phone but the battery held a weak charge. We had it replaced and then the screen went black a week before 3 months from the replacement date. We chatted on 10-19-19 and I was reassured someone would get back to me for replacement of the defective phone. It is still within 3 months of the second phone's arrival and 3.5 months from original purchase. No response and no way to contact them. Not honoring the 3 months guarantee.
<<&&&&>>
The refurbished iPhone 7 that I purchased works perfectly and has only minor cosmetic issues (which is stated in the description). The phone connected with my Verizon account and is working very well. I would recommend this phone to others and it would make a great phone for international travelers!
<<&&&&>>
Man I looked at every single comment and they were bad, exept some of them and I alredy had ordered the phone. So It took 3 days to get here to florida, and its amazing it came with a screen protector and a plastic to peel and honestly it had no scatches. Ima put up pictures in a second , it also comes with a mintfox i think or some wireless company plan that u can use for 3 months free of charge so thats pretty cool. If anyone wants to ask me about it just go and text me by instagram champs_who. Really good work these people do 5 stars all the way man.
<<&&&&>>
I needed a phone that works with Metro PCS, As soon as I open the box and saw the model # and a label that said Verizon, I knew it was the wrong item. The description says that it will work with T mobile which is the same network. Very disappointed, will return tomorrow.
<<&&&&>>
Cumple con los requisitos que promete, el teléfono venía en muy buen estado (tengo la versión jetblack de 128 gb) la pantalla sin ningún rayón y la parte trasera en muy buen estado con un poquito de desgaste, para el material que es, le puse mi chip de cricket y comenzó a funcionar, así de simple, además de los 128 GB no puedo estar más a gusto
<<&&&&>>
Remember these are refurbished phone so they’re liable of messing up. Phone is perfectly fine until it went out 60 sum days in the mother board went out. Luckily it was still with in the 90 day warranty got my refund no hassle and went and just order another phone
<<&&&&>>
My camera works when it wants,most times only the selfy side works.. I realize I love Android phones better. Love my Google pixel Lx phone much better.
<<&&&&>>
I was very skeptical and felt like I would not be happy and sending it back. That was far from the case. My order was absolutely spot on. Outside of a weird charger sent the phone itself (most important) was outstanding. This is a MUST buy as there is no way you can get this type of a deal anywhere.
<<&&&&>>
Finally upgraded my SE and at a fraction of the cost of new. And phone was like new. Still small enough to fit in my pocket and big enough I can see content better. No issues on iOS or function.
<<&&&&>>
The Iphone itself was in perfect condition. The reason why I give 3 stars is due to batter. I received it with a 92% battery condition. However 2 days later it decreased to 88 and 2 more days later to 86. Battery wouldn’t last more than 4 hours. Solution to this, i had to go to apple and replace the battery. For 50 USD they get you a new battery and the iphone works like Brand New. I really recommend this solution if you go through the same problem. However, it involves spending 50 more bucks which is annoying.
<<&&&&>>
Got a “renewed” IPhone 7 128 Gb. Phone has a small dent on the front of glass, when running a black background, you can observe light spillage, also the front facing mic by the camera is broken or not functional. Spent an hour trying to fix Siri, when I noticed that making a selfie video uses the same mic, all I heard was static noise coming through the mic. Will try to return, wish me luck
<<&&&&>>
Bought this phone a year ago, got it right before i left the country for a year. Phone worked for 2 weeks then shut off. I tried everything to fix it and took the phone to apple store as soon as i got back and they said they used wrong parts.
<<&&&&>>
Got this phone for my husband for Father’s Day. He has been unable to use it due to the phone saying “not in service”. So he’s had no phone calls, texting or using the internet. He had to contact apple and sent the phone to them to repair. I’m very unsatisfied spending over 250 on a phone to not have it work. Now my husband has to wait for this phone to get repaired to be able to use it. So disappointed!!!
<<&&&&>>
Good value of money. The appearance is excellent. The battery health is 87% and this is the only thing reminds me it's a renewed product.
<<&&&&>>
Great condition no complaints so far
<<&&&&>>
The phone had jagged chipped edges on arrival and the camera glass was cracked making photos look smeared and fuzzy. I thought this was supposed to be checked for quality, this is not a quality product at all. Extremely disappointed and annoyed to be wasting my time with a return. The only good thing is it came with a sim card for service but I will be returning this immediately nonetheless.
<<&&&&>>
So when I recieved this phone it worked greato, but after a few days I kept losing phone service. This happened twice. I finally took it to the Apple store. Come to find out there is a free repair for the problem I was having. It does take 7-10 business days for it to get sent off, but it's a very common problem and Apple will either fix the problem or send you a brand new phone. This phone IS a VERIZON refurbished phone.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was junk... I read the reviews but figured for a free return I might as well TRY it out and see if I would get a good phone.. waste of time. Believe the reviews. DONT order this phone from BuySpry
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this for my son. After 4 months, could not make or receive calls. Conveniently 1 month after the 90 day guarantee expired. Now texting doesn’t work and apps won’t download.
<<&&&&>>
The first screen died on me just two weeks after purchasing that.I took it to a repair shop they installed two new screens within two days but screens went black anyway.I got another complete screen from amazon but same thing happened. The item had a hardware or mother board issue and instead of spending more money on it ,i decided to smash it hard Total junk item.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my wife and we were very disappointed with it it was dropped one time from about 2 and 1/2 to 3 ft it shut off and never turn back on
<<&&&&>>
I love it
<<&&&&>>
Don’t buy. Failed right away bad screen, speaker, home button and battery.
<<&&&&>>
I haven’t had the phone turned on yet. From what I see everything seems to be fine.
<<&&&&>>
Phone started making weird noises right before 90 days. Loud noises. Microphone stoped working. Then he Day that happened my daughter dropped it and broke the screen! Right on the 90 day mark. Talk about a nightmare. 300 is a lot of money to throw away.
<<&&&&>>
3 months after purchase, last week 'no service' shown on iPhone , I contacted Apple Store and they sent my iPhone to repair, I got it back yesterday ; iPhone worked for a few hours, then 'no service' shown again, can't make call/receive a call; total waste!!!
<<&&&&>>
The apple phone itself works fine. After a month, the battery life shortened significantly. Now if I am going out for work more than 6 hours, it is better to bring a power cord or power bank. Also, the power cord comes with the phone is from Huawei not apple.
<<&&&&>>
This is the second iPhone 7 purchased to replace antique "flip top" phones. The renewed condition was accurately advertised and the resulting value fully meets our expectations. We will not hesitate to reorder from this company again.
<<&&&&>>
This looked brand new no signs of ever having been used. And it’s working just like it was new. I highly highly recommend.
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I just received with this phone with this problem at screen.
<<&&&&>>
I received the defective phone on the board that inviabiized the microphone and I can not use the phone for its main function that is to speak. I Wanted to know how to return it and get my money back. I Bought the device for delivery in the U.S.A. but brought to Brazil that's where I live. Now I'll have an extra charge to remit the device back.
<<&&&&>>
I was very scared at first because of previous reviews, but then I stepped out on faith and My daughter got this phone for her 15th birthday and she is in love with it!
<<&&&&>>
I noticed the screen brightness was really different from other iphones so I took it to Apple and they told me the screen is NOT original, the camera is NOT original, etc. A lot of parts of the iphone were replaced and NOT original. I lost my money buying it.
<<&&&&>>
SIM card slot is cracked. Dings and Scratches are to be expected with a refurbished phone but this one have a few dings that are bigger than I would like.. also headset sound is pretty low during calls.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this product, came a day late, and turns out it won’t work with Verizon so keep that in mind when purchasing.
<<&&&&>>
The internal antenna was broke and would not receive service. Had to take it to Apple to be looked at only to have to buy a new phone to have a working phone. Not worth it.
<<&&&&>>
Very pleased with the purchase. Every came exactly how I wanted.
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  So far, so good. The phone looks perfectly fine, it has some minor scratches, but looks great! It is fully unblocked and works pretty good. I’m really happy with the purchase!
<<&&&&>>
No problems. The phone was fully unlocked.
<<&&&&>>
Buyers BEWARE PURCHASED IPHONE 7 The phone stop working HARDWARE PROBLEM company will not answer my text messages
<<&&&&>>
No complaints
<<&&&&>>
Defective!!!!! To fix at the Apple store it’s 150 bucks! No help from Amazon.. I would have been better off using Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. First and last time I’ll use a refurbished amazon product, no customer service!
<<&&&&>>
Love my new iPhone! Works great and looks like new!
<<&&&&>>
I love this! The phone came a little scratched up but came with a screen protector which was a plus. The phone worked like new!
<<&&&&>>
The price is reasonable, shipping great, product awesome!! This is the second iPhone 7 I’ve bought from this seller and I’m so happy with both!!! Will be back when I’m ready to upgrade for sure!
<<&&&&>>
The sound from the first day that I received it was very muffled on the phone no one could hear anything we tried it for a while and nothing ever improved I was very disappointed in this phone sent it back and got a refund
<<&&&&>>
the item is exactly how it is advertised
<<&&&&>>
Item looks exactly like the pocture, however be aware that on the description it say “this is iPhone 7 Plus” which isn’t true. This is iPhone 7 not 7 Plus that’s why I gave it a 3 stars the infos were false
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone for the great Price! Love it
<<&&&&>>
Like the phone is quality, the only thing wrong is sometimes the speaker shorts out but it can be fixed by closing the app that is playing audio. Other than that it’s a good phone for the price especially with the storage
<<&&&&>>
Love it
<<&&&&>>
She loved it
<<&&&&>>
el Altavoz viene en mal estado, por lo que no es escucha bien a la hora de hablar por teléfono o reproducir un video, audio o lo que sea...
<<&&&&>>
Came in right on time, had minimal wear just a few tiny paint scratches on the top right corner nothing too bad. Came in well packaged but didn't come in original box. It's fully functional for me at the moment
<<&&&&>>
good
<<&&&&>>
Celular nuevo funciona la 100%
<<&&&&>>
Wish I knew the battery life before I purchased (was in the low 80s percent), but overall it is still working as a good back up phone.
<<&&&&>>
Love the iphones and love the money I save buying a used unlocked phone here.
<<&&&&>>
Good phone. Worth iut
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone didn’t work properly. I had to rerun it
<<&&&&>>
Phone die after 15-20 minutes of use. I understand is re-bish but still I pay more than $300.00 the camera don’t work so no pics , no videos. Not good at all
<<&&&&>>
Horrible phone, your better off paying $100 more & buying a brand new 1 from the Apple store, internet never worked on the road, at 1st we thought the problem was the phone provider, until v changed the chip to another phone, daily we had switch off & switch on the phone for the internet part to work.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is in very good shape it was well worth the money would definitely buy from seller again very impressed
<<&&&&>>
1 month and stop working fine. This i7 has a serial number that is on recall. Pls don't buy this, I can't make calls and update my phone AN EVEN TURN IT ON. waste of money
<<&&&&>>
The phone can not get any network connection after 6 months of use Apple is telling me that there is no guarantee on this phone This model number had manufacturing issues but Apple won’t exchange the phone
<<&&&&>>
I had no problems with the phone or deliver. It was exactly what they said it would be
<<&&&&>>
Devuelto estaba dañado
<<&&&&>>
Is not good
<<&&&&>>
O like so much
<<&&&&>>
Great experience I liked ,, thank you to the seller
<<&&&&>>
the battery has only 83%, the phone does not look like a new one, there are a lot of scuffs on the screen, minor scratches, there are chips on the sides. In general, only 3 stars, not more.
<<&&&&>>
Was in great condition
<<&&&&>>
I’m very disappointed, the phone came with all sorts of scratches and the screen has a blue light locate de in one area. I’m extremely disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is not working what so ever! I’m extremely upset. I’ve contacted Apple and they tell me they can’t do anything on their end. Extremely stressed and unsatisfied.
<<&&&&>>
I did have to return this item. I received the device and it was in good condition but there was a defect and the device would not read any SIM.
<<&&&&>>
So easy to get set up! This was a good update for the person this was bought for!
<<&&&&>>
2 months old and the battery is dead. Phone is completely nonfunctional.
<<&&&&>>
Touch screen not working sometimes
<<&&&&>>
Perfect,came earlier than expected and runs amazingly well,no cellular data problems or scratches great battery life and I’m happy with this purchase
<<&&&&>>
bought the phone and the battery wasn't good and the mic and speaker were terrible. can't hear when someone's talking.
<<&&&&>>
Good quality and it works well. But the battery life is about 90%. But if you think about the price, this choice will be good.
<<&&&&>>
La batería está deteriorada. El móvil se descarga en 30 minutos cuando se está usando. Muy mala inversión
<<&&&&>>
I tossed my phone in the trash!!! It crashed and never turned on!! You owe me my money for selling defective product.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in perfect condition, as if it was brand new. Though the charger and lighting cable aren’t original.
<<&&&&>>
La verdad me salió muy bueno
<<&&&&>>
Phone is locked. This is deception!!!
<<&&&&>>
the phone is conserved but the battery is not good. The seller should inform in the descriptions.
<<&&&&>>
I loved it . Only thing wrong is it look like someone opened my phone box 🙄 . Other than that NO problems at all 💓
<<&&&&>>
Phone lasted for just a month and stopped working
<<&&&&>>
Received a broken phone
<<&&&&>>
Celular prácticamente nuevo, la batería esta a un 100%. Muy buena compra.
<<&&&&>>
The FaceTime on this phone is not working when you answer a call it immediately says FaceTime failed
<<&&&&>>
Phone had an error message that says the modem is messed up and to restart when I do it says no service. Hopefully this company will make it right!
<<&&&&>>
Back camera is messed up and there were a lot of scratches when I got it
<<&&&&>>
Llevo más de dos años con él y sigue sin ningún detalle
<<&&&&>>
Did not work when I received it. I tried to contact the sender with no reply
<<&&&&>>
I can’t make calls I try other SIM cards but is not reading it
<<&&&&>>
Everything about the phone works good. Love the storage too 128gb is worth
<<&&&&>>
Amazing . . . Minimum To No Scratches , Fast And Easy Setup .
<<&&&&>>
I like everything about the phone Except the battery life.

Best purchase this year!
<<&&&&>>
It only came with one tiny little scratch, which was expected. But besides that, I pretty much love it!
<<&&&&>>
The phone is pretty good, almost like a new one, and the service is satisfying.
<<&&&&>>
phone lasted about one week, total piece of junk
<<&&&&>>
This phone came with a scratched screen and back. It looks very used and old. The charger it came with doesn’t work.

Hello I am a really big iPhone lover and would love to promote this product thousands of followers on my Instagram and YouTube by testing your product
<<&&&&>>
Having had no choice since my iPhone 5s died, I had to get a new cell phone. I looked at NEW Verizon plans (ahhh, no thank you) and other providers and decided to stay with Verizon, but get a refurbished phone. The question was now: Android or another iPhone. After reviewing um-teen million reviews, I decided on another (yawn...!) iPhone (shocking!) Now the question was, WHICH iPhone (another yawn). I heard about problems with the 6, the iPhone Pluses were tooo big and the 8s and up were toooo expensive for my needs (hey, it’s only a PHONE!), so I decided on a....you guessed it, refurbished 7. Well, I am not disappointed. Slightly larger than my 5s, more memory (bunches more!) and in very good condition...NO scratches, gouges, or screen problems. My only complaint is the home button is strange. I like the the old mechanical home button better, it had a better feel, but then, I’m an old, non-vegan, meat-n-potato’s, non-gaming, non-craft beer, non-tweeting guy who grew up with rotary phones at home, and pay phones on the road. All in all, I give this phone, and the seller, a 9 out of 10 after a week of use and loading apps and discovering new features. I’ll check back after 6 months and update. Well, it’s late August 2019, and I couldn’t be happier with this purchase!!! Absolutely NO regrets!!!
<<&&&&>>
phone works great and was in great condition. Didn't receive any cables or accessories with it. There IS a shutter sound when you take a picture EVERY SINGLE TIME (my older model muted this if it was in silent mode, but not the case on this phone). If you use this primarily for photography, particularly in public, this might be annoying to you! Saw another reviewer had commented on this but I purchased anyway, almost wish that I hadn't, as it annoys me more than I thought it would.
<<&&&&>>
Delivery: I ordered this on 11/1 and it was literally delivered by 11/2. Condition Upon Arrival: I inspected the phone after opening and had to look very very closely to see the two little scratches on the back. And I do mean VERY closely. I use a case so it mattered even less. Switching phones: There were no issues taking my TMobile SIM card (have used it for about 2 years now) out of my old phone, putting it in this new one (I used an earring to open the little slot on the side of the phones), and getting this one turned on. It accepted my Sim right away and the setup process began. Setup: It has never been this easy for me to get a new phone set up. After choosing language, entering WiFi password, and putting in Apple ID, it asked me if I wanted to transfer everything from my last iCloud back up. I chose the ‘yes’ option and it said I could just place my old phone next to my new one. Once I unlocked my old phone, I backed it up again (so that it would be as recent as possible). After that was done, I put the two phones (both unlocked) next to each other and the transfer automatically began. Within minutes (maybe 10-15 at most) my new phone had all the apps, pictures/videos, and settings of my old phone. Another point for technology! Comparison to old phone: my last phone was an iPhone 6 (had that exact device for about a year and a half) and honestly, what really prompted the switch was that the touchscreen part of very edge of the right side and bottom were no longer responsive (which was getting really irritating when it came to using my keyboard or accessing options on those parts). This phone (iPhone 7) is the exact same size so I was able to slide it right into the same phone case (which I’m happy about). It took the first few uses to get used to the feel of the home button but it’s not as off putting as I thought it’d be. The camera quality is slightly crisper but I don’t notice a *huge* difference (no surprise as it’s only one generation up). The lack of earphone jack hasn’t been an issue because I use a Bluetooth earpiece (Jabra Talk, to be exact; super old school but I love it because it wraps around my ear and regular earbuds tend to just slip out; plus, I don’t need to have my phone on me, when I walk around and can go into a whole nother room. Anyway....). It might be an issue later though bc if I’m in the middle of a call and my earpiece dies, I usually switch to regular earphones. Guess I’ll eventually have to get the piece that lets you connect the two.... Battery life: It doesn’t take long to charge fully. That said, I can’t be sure but I think the battery tends to get drained a bit quicker than I’d expect (though that could just mean that I use it a whole lot throughout the day). Anyway, it hasn’t been long but overall, the phone is holding up.
<<&&&&>>
This has been the biggest mistake of my life. This product will not work properly on Verizon. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get it to. Nothing. I will never make this mistake again. The incredible amount of time and money I have wasted is Unfathomable.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this phone so I could use it in Korea with a local SIM and because I need to return my primary phone to the manufacturer for a warranty repair for ~30 days and wanted to use it as a backup when I returned to the US. Not sure exactly what the inspection process is as far as "renewing" or refurbishing, but the SIM card reader was unable to locate a SIM (tried with several working SIM cards from different carriers & tried the new SIM in other phones without any issues). As if that wasn't disappointing enough, the battery would quickly drain (within ~2-3 hours) *EVEN WHEN THE DEVICE WAS TURNED OFF*. Amazon tech service was unable to sort out the issue and when they put me in touch with Apple, we literally could not get them to pick up the phone for >30 minutes. I'll try another Amazon-supported unlocked iPhone once I get my return credit and I'm hoping the inspection is a bit more thorough this time. I'm also bummed I spent ~$100 in prepaid SIM cards that I have never able to use.
<<&&&&>>
My husband is retiring and was giving up his company phone. He didn't want to have to spend a huge amount on a brand new iPhone because he doesn't use it that much. So this was a great alternative, one model prior and works and looks like new. We set it up with with low cost carrier that offers a great value for unlimited, you just pop in a SIM. It turns out teh screen is actually the same size as my iPhone 8, so this was really a good deal.
<<&&&&>>
The refurb had a replacement screen and 84% battery health. The body was 9/10 with only one very small ding in the bottom right corner, which is paint matched and unnoticeable unless you're looking for it. You can tell the screen isn't the original when holding it up to a new iphone 7 and diagnostics confirms that. The screen and 84% battery health knocks off at least two stars.
<<&&&&>>
I got a refurbished gold iPhone 7 with 128 GB of flash memory from ElectroWireless. I would recommend anyone to buy a refurbished iPhone. The iPhone I got come on time, and showed very little signs of use. Everything works: touch ID, front and read cameras, facetime, WiFi, Bluetooth, and 4G on T-Mobile (GSM). The only thing I did not like was that I got the phone with a battery health around 82%. It can still hold a whole day of usage without problem, but I think the page description should state that the battery might not be a new one.
<<&&&&>>
Came with couple of scratches on the back but it’s fine with me is going to get scratch anyways. The front is ok. But the battery does not last. I have to stay next to a outlet. Or just lower the brightness when I go somewhere. I got it because I live in the city is one the most dangerous city in the US so Incase something goes down I can call the cops.
<<&&&&>>
On the outside the iPhone was perfect. but the battery came with 78% and the iPhone did not connect with the carrier chip
<<&&&&>>
Battery was not replaced before I purchased it which it should’ve been since those are a problem with these iPhones .. I had to go to Apple I have the battery replaced but other than that the phone is awesome
<<&&&&>>
Despite some of the reviews here, the product that I received is absolutely excellent. It is working perfectly so far after a few days. I confirmed that the iPhone is not stolen, battery is in excellent condition, the appearance of the phone looks new and everything works perfectly including modem. It arrived on time in a box with charger and cable. Headphones were not included but this was clearly indicated, so no surprise. Highly recommended.
<<&&&&>>
So far, so good. The battery seems to last quite awhile (for a teenager). It came in like new condition. No visible issues. My son has had it for about a month and it is working great for him.
<<&&&&>>
Bought as a gift for my son he love it.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is the worst!! There have been so many issues since I bought it! I have tried to get the battery fixed by apple but it’s way too expensive! Wish I had bought from a better company!
<<&&&&>>
Issues with the video function, no sound after recording. Also, the camera function is faulty, not able to turn the "click" sound off, even with the ringer off and adjusted the sound setting.
<<&&&&>>
Very disappointed. Phone was a model no longer sold due to an irreparable software issue that apple would give a warranty for had it been purchased there. Waste of time without a phone twice. Two thumbs down on this one.
<<&&&&>>
It was like new and had a screen protector already installed. No earphones included.
<<&&&&>>
haven't had any trouble yet and have kids that break screens like it's a hobby.
<<&&&&>>
The condition of this refurbished iPhone 7 from Chubbiestech was very good cosmetically, it was packaged well and professionally and every feature of the phone works as expected *EXCEPT* Apple Pay, which will not work. I'm positive it's the phone because my wife's iPhone 7 works everywhere that this one doesn't :(
<<&&&&>>
As advertised. Daughter loves it. Great price.
<<&&&&>>
Never really got to try this out. They claimed Fully Unlocked, but Sprint Tech support couldn’t get it activated on their network. Ended up returning for a refund.
<<&&&&>>
“Ear speaker” has poor quality of sound. It sounds like the caller on the other end is far away. I checked the settings and it is not a software issue. It presents as it is dying or was refurbished with an inferior replacement part.
<<&&&&>>
I am very impressed by the condition of the phone. Like new all the way around. Everything works and it holds all of the charge as if it were new. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Upgraded from a 5s. Has more features than my 5s, the battery seems to be lasting longer, the fingerprint reader doesn’t work well. So far I am happy with this phone over the 5s.
<<&&&&>>
VERY NICE
<<&&&&>>
Completely ready for a sim card and activation. Working perfectly. No complaints.
<<&&&&>>
Great product. Recommend to anyone.
<<&&&&>>
The battery life is only 50%. I bought a new battery and was refunded the price of the battery
<<&&&&>>
it was ok
<<&&&&>>
It was like I've expected.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is awesome! It came 2 days EARLY and it came with a charger and it came with 38% charge! Now, I read like 100 reviews that it wasn't unlocked, let me clear ALL that up, this phone IS GSM UNLOCKED meaning if you use a service provider such as Metro PCS or T- Mobile or other GSM service providers, this phone will work! Now if you use CDMA network( Sprint/Verizon) it might not work but that is not this seller's fault because VERY CLEARLY STATED in the product description this is a GSM unlocked phone. So don't buy it and expect it to work with CDMA Network and then write a bad review when it doesn't. This phone is certified refurbished through Amazon and it is like a brand new iPhone! Also, if you're switching from 6plus or 6s and below keep in mind that the 7 and up don't have a home "button" per say.. like it doesn't push in so the home button is not broken it just doesn't make that clicking sound the older phones make.
<<&&&&>>
Did not receive the iphone plus i ordered, inside the phone box was only the wall plug and phone cord and a screen protector, if i could rate 0 i would!!!
<<&&&&>>
No wear or tear at all. Packages nicely, and seems to work as new. Will update.
<<&&&&>>
it’s good condition?? broken glass and can’t switch on?? different imei numbers. how??? made return.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is physically fine. It has a software glitch. The screen freezes and might not work for a hour or 2 and starts working. All I want is another phone because I understand things happen. They will not exchange it. 2 phone calls later they said they are sending me return info. 3 days later I have not received it. Do not order from this company. They are 70 dollars more directly from apple and you have no problems. Now I am stuck with a 500 piece of junk.
<<&&&&>>
I've just received the product iPhone 7 Plus Red 128GB yesterday. So far , so good, I'm really pleased with the phone, it came in great condition, except one significant scratch on the apple logo, which is a little bit disappointed, but it's fine. Every function works fine the past couple of days, hope it will last long. I will let you guys know if there are any later issues.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was packaged nicely and phone was in excellent condition. Phone was GSM unlocked which made it very easy to set my service up on it (MetroPCS). Only thing I didn’t like was it did not come with headphones. Still 5 stars tho!
<<&&&&>>
Fast delivery and arrived in perfect shape. Two differences between this and a new iPHone... The Cost! and the word Refurbished. Update... have now bought 3 of them and all were and still are perfect.
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks brand new- not one scratch or dent. It works fast and the battery holds great. It also was fully unlocked and arrived quickly. It came with a brand new iPhone charger too!
<<&&&&>>
I enjoyed the phone for less than four months before it stopped excepting a charge and went completely dead.MyWit will not fix or replace it or refund $! Beware of this seller.
<<&&&&>>
As expected . Looks and works like New .
<<&&&&>>
Exactly why I bought it!
<<&&&&>>
JUST CAME WITH CHARGER AND THE WALL SOCKET., UNLIKE THE EXPLANATION MENTIONED THAT IT WILL BE SHIPPED WITH ALL THE ACCESSORIES..!
<<&&&&>>
Was not unlocked, had to return to sender.
<<&&&&>>
So far I cannot put this phone down I wake up just to use it.. I recieved the phone and it is absolutely amazing I just love it it came in perfect condition no looks new to me.
<<&&&&>>
Very good condition! No complaints
<<&&&&>>
Great phone! very Good condition
<<&&&&>>
Last year I bought from ably company a refurbished iPad and it looked great, still works great. So I decided to give it a try to the phone. But this phone came scratched and with a very dirty speaker and charging slot. Looks very used... It said it was apple refurbished but guess not... came on a Samsung box and also the charger is pretty crappy too. So advice buy another one on your own. Let’s see how it works...
<<&&&&>>
Phone says it’s unlocked but it does not read the SIM card. Frustrating when I paid $324 for the phone and now I have to mail it back and wait for a refund. And I know the Sim card works because I put it back in my original phone and it works just fine. Defective product.
<<&&&&>>
I just recieved this Item, iPhone 7 plus suppose to be unlocked. The iphone was ok and wrapped just fine. But phone it's not unlock keep asking apple ID. They advertise unlock but it's not I try to contact the seller to unlock so I can used or else I have to return.I hate to return I like the iPhone 7 plus if the seller would unlock it. They have a good feedback that's the reason I order from this seller cause they do have good feedback.hey what should I do if I cant used it. I have to return.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was blocked by fraud, I need to return because I can’t use. It’s a bad choice.
<<&&&&>>
I previously had an IPhone 6s Plus and was having to continually charge it. I can use this phone all day and still have charge.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we celebrated Christmas 2 days early. Unboxed it and set it up and I made a phone call to said phone and the volume was very muted...even all the way up. Thankfully my daughter is the sweetest and understood I had to take her iPhone and send it it back...not happy but amazon is refunding me the money...refused to replace it bc it was malfunctioning. Ordering her another one from a different seller. Not a happy mom!
<<&&&&>>
The phone looked alright but when I started using it I realised the earpiece is not working and I can't hear anything when I get a call. I sent a message to the seller and they haven't even answered my message.
<<&&&&>>
Came on time. Looks new. Works great!
<<&&&&>>
Extremely bad, well the inside of the phone works fine but outside is extremely scratched it’s nothing like the description says, it has the sim door bent, sides completely scratch as well as the camera glass and screen
<<&&&&>>
This purchase was the worst ever! The phone does NOT work. Don’t waste your money. There was so much static and interference and when you answer an incoming call, it sounds like “water running” down a drain.
<<&&&&>>
This phone was a great purchase very pleased with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
The speaker worked very poorly. You can barely hear someone speak even when the volume is all the way up
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in great condition and has been working perfectly since buying it.
<<&&&&>>
Arrived with a cracked home button. I needed to send it right back.
<<&&&&>>
Son is really enjoying his phone.
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone 7plus is a can't use it That is Broke
<<&&&&>>
I love the phone but it doesn’t work I’m reaching out in a message and I’ve also called and had to leave a message and I’m not getting a faster response!!
<<&&&&>>
It said it's rose gold but I got gold but overall it's good expect it doesn't come with the earbuds
<<&&&&>>
This product is broken
<<&&&&>>
At first, the scene got hot, but it works beautifully.
<<&&&&>>
Really like it, it works well, youll just have to buy a new charger cause it comes with a bad one
<<&&&&>>
The top speaker is not working and the finger print reader is crack
<<&&&&>>
Awesome product
<<&&&&>>
Goid
<<&&&&>>
I absolutely love my new phone 💜🥰
<<&&&&>>
Battery does not last
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks great
<<&&&&>>
thanks for iPhone 7 plus
<<&&&&>>
Phone overheated.
<<&&&&>>
The device was stolen when it was delivered
<<&&&&>>
I never write reviews, NEVER, but this product definitely deserves one. My brother purchased this phone a few moths ago and it is amazing! I use it for all my social media pictures, profiles, etc. It loads everything EXTREMELY quick. The quality is the best I have ever seen! Apple really stepped up their game with this one. I thought not having a headphone jack would be an issue considering I am always listening to music, but the adapter that transfers music from the power port is great! I don't have to turn up my music nearly as loud as I used to. I would definitely recommend this phone and I don't even have one yet! I am planning on ordering one for myself that way I can stop using my brothers...lol
<<&&&&>>
Apple keeps making more and more fragile products. The 7 Plus must be encased in a hard case with a screen protector. If this is not done from day one, the product will break. The screen will crack, the button will crack. The case will bend. It cannot be dropped from even six inches. It is a delicate piece of garbage. Apps work as expected. But Apple has become a different company since the death of Steve Jobs. This will be my last Apple product. If you own stock in this company consider selling. They are likely not going to continue to be an innovation leader.
<<&&&&>>
Everyrhing ok, except that didn't came with the EarPods neither Lightning Connector.
<<&&&&>>
I would like to cancel order
<<&&&&>>
The phone came with bad scratches both on the front and back. So badly scratched, in fact, that it’s as if someone tried to open the phone with a knife. And this statement “Professionally inspected and tested to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear“ is a misrepresentation.
<<&&&&>>
Looks almost brand new! I have to buy used phones a lot, definitely happy with this one
<<&&&&>>
This product arrived defective. Rear wide-angle camera does not work at all. All other functions OK. Amazon shipped a replacement phone. It is more defective than the first --- speaker does not work at all. Cannot hear through either the phone, and unable to activate Speaker. Spent 2 1/2 hours on this one yesterday. Amazon support switched me to Apple Care. We removed and reinstalled everything, including the SIM Card, which continues to work fine on my first defective phone. Shipping BOTH phones back to AMAZON today and reinstalled the SIM in my iPhone 6 and it works perfectly. A waste of time, and until I get my refund, a waste of $$$.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this to be as close to a new phone a possible. It came with no real box, and no headphones. Very upset. And definitely not worth the money now. So much for it being a Christmas present. If I could give you 0 stars, that would be too many.
<<&&&&>>
I could not activate phone when it arrived very dissipointed in the product yor tecnitions need to do a better job refurbition the phones hope you can make this right Terry Rohlin
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in SILVER when I ordered ROSE GOLD. The phone is unlocked and in almost perfect condition, no problems yet. If everything checks out I reccomend this product. Update: the company issued me some money back for the color issue. The phone is working almost perfect, I am so happy with my purchase. I recommend this product!
<<&&&&>>
Everything the description said it would be. Delivered on time & I love it! Many thanks to the seller. Totally trustable and I will absolutely shop with them again the next time I need to.
<<&&&&>>
Nice.... my daughter love it
<<&&&&>>
Nice
<<&&&&>>
Nice product!
<<&&&&>>
EXCELENT
<<&&&&>>
at the moment everything it's ok
<<&&&&>>
I don't have an iPhone 7 plus yet but I will love to promote your product !!! My friend just got one it's very unique and easy to use its the best iPhone 7 plus ever!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
Doesn't have headbud jack and didn't come unlocked. Forget the good price because after you pay for everything else missing, it WILL NOT be a bargain anymore.
<<&&&&>>
Physically, phone was great, no visible scratches... However the battery life was poor ( couldn't last a day). Phone was not unlocked to my current network as promised..In spite of all the negatives i decided to continue using it, as it was a refurbished phone. After three weeks of using this phone the screen just started blanking out and would reboot by its self... the last time it blanked out it didn't reboot... Thus y reasons for wanting a total refund on this purchase... thank you!
<<&&&&>>
phone stopped working shortly after use. nothing wrong i did on my part. no water damage or physical damage. battery was broken and certain memory features
<<&&&&>>
The phone came packaged in a box, two days after I ordered it. Mint condition. Charger included, no headphones. There were two minor, barely visible scratches on the back of the phone. No other visible evidence that it was a previously owned phone, that’s how excellent the condition of this phone. Had one small issue with service connection, but my service provider was able to rectify that in 5 minutes. Have the phone a month now, no issues at all. If you’re wondering whether to buy this phone, stop hesitating. I was skeptical as well and I’m so happy I bought it. Buy the phone, you won’t regret it.
<<&&&&>>
Wasnt sure what to expect, honestly, I was really apprehensive.. but.. absolutely clean and working perfectly.... so far... I will come back and give feedback after a month.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in excellent condition, had all accessories, and the color is great! Nothing negative.
<<&&&&>>
The preview of the camera shakes uncontrollably and doesn’t focus. Purchased warranty and have attempted to reconcile issues with seller with zero response.
<<&&&&>>
Im so disappointed first off the box the phone came in wasn't even nice. It was just a random box plain box. You open it up and it doesn't have anything protecting the phone. It had a scartch on the back of the phone. For 255.00 dollars I expected it to look like knew. No manual, no head phones, the charger is not even the charger that came with the phone. It is some after market charger. This is for my daughter for Christmas and it.looks like I bought it off the street. I bought the same phone from Cricket for my other daughter for 200.00 brand new. But they only had one left so I resorted to Amazon to come through. What a complete disappointment.
<<&&&&>>
I spent almost $300 on a rose gold 6s plus and when I got it, it looked fine no scratches no nothing but when I tried to use my sim it didn't work and so we entered the phones IMEI number into the T-mobile database and it said that this phone was reported stolen and since it was reported stolen it was locked so that no one could use it with a sim. Honestly, my best bet for if you want to buy a phone online buy it from eBay but make sure the person has close to a 99% review rate.
<<&&&&>>
There was no implications that this phone was coming from Japan. It has the camera shutter on all the time. There is no way going around this effect. It is best to just return the item. There is also a small dent on the sound button on/off. I am extremely disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
i lost my iphone awhile ago & i got this one now to replace it i guess... should’ve thought about buying from amazon sooner!
<<&&&&>>
Very good phone. I’m very glad pleased with it! Would buy this again
<<&&&&>>
No major dents or scratches. Everything seems to be in excellent condition. Was easy to set up to my sprint account but did not come with a SIM card so I had to go into the store.
<<&&&&>>
Impecable
<<&&&&>>
Bello iPhone
<<&&&&>>
I love this phone! It came fast! Its like brand new! They also sent a free 3 month Mint Mobile card! 3months free Mint mobile with 8gb of data, unlimited talk and text! No strings attached! Thank you sooo much!
<<&&&&>>
It’s the phone I’m using now to write this review. 😌 I’m super pleased with the purchase. It also came earlier than expected. It’s kinda hard to think this phone was used lol it’s so like new! Works well and goes beyond satisfactory.
<<&&&&>>
Arrived on time in immaculate condition. This phone looked brand new! Could not be more pleased and for the price, it was worth every penny!
<<&&&&>>
No good
<<&&&&>>
Love my phone. Had to replace the battery within three weeks of using it. Had it checked out to see if it really needed one first and the technician say it did.
<<&&&&>>
It had a defect, the iPhone 6s Plus screen was cheap/poorly placed, so it would always clicked random letters; but I got the screen replaced and it works perfectly now.
<<&&&&>>
Exactly what I wanted and on time. Thx
<<&&&&>>
Like New my phone
<<&&&&>>
No complaints so far no scatches and works just fine no complaints
<<&&&&>>
Salió defectuoso y dañando !!!
<<&&&&>>
So far everything is working well. I’m really happy with my new phone and with the delivery. The phone came in with a charger and headphones,plus the phone itself looks almost new
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and its in perfect condition, looks like new and it came with one original Apple charger. Whatsmore, I can say Its a trully fully unlocked one because Even though i am usong it in Uruguay, it works perfectly well. I strongly recommend this product.
<<&&&&>>
So far the phone has been working great , no problems very happy with it . Phone looks like new.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is stuck on headphones. And gets hot fast.
<<&&&&>>
I will never buy used again
<<&&&&>>
Good condition no scratches, Apple Pay doesn’t work on mine which was part of the reason I bought the phones otherwise everything is fine.
<<&&&&>>
Phone battery suck...it doesn't last
<<&&&&>>
iPhone 6s Plus arrived in excellent condition. I was able to set it up easily. So far no problem.
<<&&&&>>
Everything works fine it just doesn’t come with earbuds.
<<&&&&>>
Almost like pretty new
<<&&&&>>
Perfecto estado y funcionamiento, funciona en argentina, 100% recomendable.
<<&&&&>>
Arrived quickly, just as described!
<<&&&&>>
I bought this in February 2018 . I was so excited because it was so beautiful , no dent or scratches anywhere. Everything works perfect . I hope stays like this for few more years :))

Most important thing to be aware of is the battery 'Performance' percentage, which is quoted as if it is between 1-100 of the life. Apple defines percentage of battery performance based on a minimum 80% requirement, the phone will not function correctly once the battery drops to an 80% performance, you need to replace the battery at 80%. These phones will come with battery levels in the low 80's%, so plan on getting a new battery shortly.

Bad phone-Bad Seller “Breed” - I will never do business w/this seller again. iPhone 6s+ lost sound intermittently so the called party said they could not hear me. Volume would not adjust up to any degree. Battery ran down within a few hours and thumb ID would not work. Seller refused to warranty or replace. Caveat emptor! Buyer beware!
<<&&&&>>
My daughter is delighted with this phone. It looks brand new and has been working fine with no problems. She loves the larger screen and greater storage than her old phone.
<<&&&&>>
I had my phone since like February or March and it’s July now and it’s still alive!!
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone, everything was perfect as described 👍
<<&&&&>>
So far my phone is working perfectly fine as a new one thank you so much
<<&&&&>>
I love my phone.
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
I love the iPhone and it's seems in great condition.
<<&&&&>>
Great deal
<<&&&&>>
I just purchased this to replace my old phone. The phone itself works fine, I was able to transfer everything including service and am loving the battery life and 'Hey, Siri' capability. However, the description clearly stated that it would come with an OEM charger. For those who don't know, 'OEM stands for "Original Equipment Manufacturer". An OEM charger means that it was made by the same manufacturer which manufactured your phone/tablet/laptop, whatever your case may be. It will target the same specifications as your device'. So I should have received an Apple charger and wall adapter but instead have an off.
<<&&&&>>
So I knew I was buying a used phone and maybe I got a bad one. A couple gripes, the earpiece was so caked with crud that I couldn’t even hear. Spent an hour scraping yellow crap out of it, it’s finally about 30% open and semi usable. The battery was at 60% health according to the system settings. Lastly they slapped a very low quality screen in the phone and called it good. I have 3 light spots where the panel seems pinched or something and the pressure touch only works on about 1/3rd of the screen. Now here’s my problem with all this, if I had purchased a “certified pre owned” phone (like the box it came in said) I would probably expect some of these things. My expectation of refurbish is a high quality restoration. That is not what I recieved.
<<&&&&>>
Everything was OK till I use the phone. I saw a damaged pixel (high quite light) on the screen and this type of description is important when you aré buying refurbished phone. This data didn t appear in the post.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had this phone for a couple of months now. This phone arrived on time (through Amazon Prime), in excellent condition and has been working great since.
<<&&&&>>
I quote Amazon: "Inspected and guaranteed to have minimal cosmetic damage, which is not noticeable when the device is held at arms' length." You'll be the judge about MINIMAL COSMETIC DAMAGE, see photos below (all 4 corners). And I can see the damage from 6 feet away. For $200 you should get a phone that does not look like it's been thrown off a car then ran over a couple of times. Very disappointing, particularly since I bought a renewed phone a couple of years ago that was absolutely spotless. Oh, yeah, for full disclosure, the phone seems to work... UPDATE: after about 1 hour of use, the phone started to heat up near the camera area (and I mean real hot), and a volume control pop-up randomly appeared on the screen with a strong buzz. Looking at settings, a message says: "your battery health is significantly degraded". And the vendor promised "over 80%". Junk, junk and more junk, asked Amazon to get a refund and return, beware, they are no longer as nice as they used to be, now they want you to deal with the vendor directly. Took me half an hour the get them to relent and refund directly + free home pick-up return.
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself is in really nice condition with minimal wear. I haven't transferred services yet, so can't comment on call quality or the status of the fully unlocked. I am pretty disappointed that the battery is "significantly degraded" and will need replacing. That should have been taken care of before they sold it! I'll update my review once i get the phone fully up and working.
<<&&&&>>
Had for about a week and pretty pleased with it. The only thing is the battery, I knew the battery Health was gonna be at 80% when I bought it, I just didn’t know how crappy it would actually be though. I was getting 6 hours from fully charged to dead from just mild use. 70% to 0 from just not plugging in before I went to sleep. I did replace the battery and now I’m very pleased, almost a day and a half of power from one charge. I recommend you go ahead and buy a new battery when you buy this phone if not you’ll more than likely end up returning it.
<<&&&&>>
This phone functions well for the most part and was a good value, I think, for a refurbished iPhone. However, the proximity sensor on mine seems to not work properly. So I always press buttons with my face while on phone calls, whether dialing or accidentally placing the phone on mute. This can be a real nuisance when having any sort of important phone conversation that I can't place on speakerphone. Additionally, the phone only has 80-some% of its original battery capacity. I thought this was something that was "refurbished" along with the phone, but that part could be my misunderstanding.
<<&&&&>>
Did not meet Amazon Renewed specs out of the box. Large, deep scratches visible from several feet away and the iphone case is visibly bent. After a HUGE fiasco on the phone, I was given only two options: an Amazon GC or 50% off the item. I took the 50% as I am leaving on a trip and need a GSM phone, and have no time to wait, plus it looked like the product might not have even been available. I would not trust the seller "Breed" nor would I recommend an "Amazon Renewed" product- total gamble it looks like to me if you really look through these reviews. On the plus side, because the case is bent and I'm sure a replacement screen would not fit, it has the original, albeit very scratched, retina display. Overall very disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
Did not come “professionally cleaned”. There were greasy fingerprints, gooey crap on the back, and the microphone holes and jack input on the bottom had crusty crap inside, like flakes of skin and nasty mucus. UPDATE: Removed the plastic screen protector to replace with a glass on I purchased separately, and the screen had faint scratches ALL OVER the screen like the phone was rubbed on sand(?!?). Luckily the adhesive for the glass protector filled in the gaps and it looks good. I also noticed a hairline crack of ~2mm from the edge of the home button. So far it hasn't spread, but I can see it being a future problem to be wary of with normal wear and usage. UPDATE: After using the speaker extensively, I noticed the sound quality is worse than an old iPhone 5s. It sounds like a cheap speaker that hasn't been burned in. The sound is loud and the maximum setting projects nicely but the sound quality is sub-par for this generation iPhone. Did not come with manufacturer made cable and charging plug(Apple). It was some random generic off-brand, but the listing did say they may be. Although the description portion says it won’t work with Verizon or Sprint, it has so far (~1day). The features and details contradicts the Description and says those two carrier do work as well. UPDATE: Still working on-network taking calls, voice mail, texts, and iMessage (~4days). Phone got EXTREMELY HOT when downloading data to the point of burning skin if held too long. UPDATE: Phone still gets hot downloading small MB downloads. Battery was NOT “at least 80% capacity” in settings and had a message to service the battery. Will be testing battery life extensively. UPDATE: (~4 days) Battery lasts fairly well with extensive screen, location, and bluetooth usage. Even streaming is fairly light on battery usage. The battery does take a long time to charge up, however(1-2 hours from 50-100%).
<<&&&&>>
Phone was defective. Sent it back.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t want to spend a fortune on phones for our 10 and 11 year old children, so we opted to buy these. We purchased two of them. They arrived on time, in an iPhone box, clearly marked as “fully unlocked” and in a timely manner. The phones both look brand new, not so much as a tiny scratch can be found. I took them to the AT&T store to get SIM cards and to get them activated. Even the technician was impressed with the quality. Both phones were up and running in 15 minutes and perform perfectly. VERY pleased with this purchase. TWO BIG THUMBS UP!!!
<<&&&&>>
The product description for this phone indicated that it would look and work like a new phone. The box it was in was a generic box, not an apple box, which is as per description. When I opened it, the phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and looked flawless - no blemishes as all. I purchased this for my wife who had an iPhone 5. I took the sim-card out of the iPhone 5 and put it in this 6S and it was up and running - every bit as easy as that. Putting the sim card into it connected it to our Verizon wireless account and she was able to use all features - phone, text, and email (after the email was set up.) The sim-card DID NOT transfer any data files like pictures, notes, etc. We had to transfer those ourselves. After we had the phone for perhaps 3 or 4 weeks, it stopped working - not texts and no calls. I called Verizon, and I don't know what they did, but it was very soon fully operational again so that problem obviously was NOT the phone. Pros: As far as I'm concerned this phone is a total positive with one tiny exception and that is that the battery health as registered on the phone is about 87%. I consider this to be very acceptable for a refurbished phone. Cons: Except for the slight battery degradation, - NONE. I will update this review if future issues arise, but for now, I'm happy as a lark.
<<&&&&>>
I was able to get the phone unlocked on Sprint after dealing with their terrible customer service telling me it was not possible. The trick is to get a brand new SIM card (from a retail location or shipped) and have the customer service activate the SIM and transfer your number to the new card. Sprint SIM cards are locked to both the IMEI and ICCID (IMEI must match ICCID in Sprint's system). The "refurbished" part of this is where it gets tricky. It seems like the device I received was originally a rose gold device that had it's internals swapped to a new phone. iTunes recognizes it as a rose gold and so does Sprint through the IMEI. The screen has slight ghosting, but it is hard to notice unless you are looking hard. The device was not refurbished with OEM parts (except maybe the back casing).
<<&&&&>>
Bought this iPhone 6s, and selected Amazon as seller hoping for a better renewed one. How wrong was I! The screen looks to have been replaced with a new one. Based on how the screen brightness changed quite a bit when viewed under a pair of rotating polarized sunglasses, the screen could well be non-OEM. The big issue, however, is the battery, whose max capacity is only at 79% of the original. Per Apple, this battery is used up and needs to be replaced. The stickers at the back of the phone for the condition classification, as well as the temper-proof tape covering the screen edge, all have Chinese characters, so most likely this one was renewed in China. Hugely disappointed at Amazon failing to ensure quality of its own items.
<<&&&&>>
It took amazon 3 tries to deliver the phone that is somewhat free from cosmetic wear and tear. Even then the battery on the third phone they sent was shot. So if you expect “...looks and works like new, ...no visible defects from a distance of 12”...” and “battery tested, and guaranteed to perform at 80% capacity “ you will be disappointed. As always Amazon’s customers service is second to none, after all they replaced the phone twice, and when the battery was no good, they gave me a $25 credit toward a purchase of a new battery
<<&&&&>>
I received my iPhone 6S on time. I was replacing an iPhone 5 and I went through the process of transferring everything from OLD PHONE to NEW PHONE. After a few minor growing pains related to different versions of APPS running on the NEW PHONE, I can say there is no way I would go back. There were a few minor chips and scratches on the screen but to find them a person would have to inspect the screen very carefully. These chips and scratches do not impact the functionality of the phone.
<<&&&&>>
This was not actually unlocked. i cannot use it with my verizon sim card at all. I have wasted time and money on this. Now I have to send it back and hope I get a refund. Also the charger cube that came with it was a Samsung brand. That's just not what we bought.
<<&&&&>>
This company sends out phones with dead batteries. After buying a case, a SIM card, and transferring all my data over to this phone, and THEN finding out it had a bad battery, this company would only stand behind their warranty. They would not stand behind their product. This company wanted me to send the phone back(after all my work and money) because it had a bad battery that they knew was bad before they sent it to me. Do not do business with this company.
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone because my old phone’s battery was horrible. This phone has been slightly better, but not at all what I was expecting. I bought it used/refurbished but I didn’t realize the battery would be so bad Update: I purchased a new battery for $20 and it works awesome. Apple is also doing a promotion until New Years for iPhone 6, new batteries for $30
<<&&&&>>
I studied the sellers very carefully and got to the conclusion that this seller was very responsible. I bought 1 iPhone 6 64gb Unlocked refurbished and 1 iPhone 6s 64gb Unlocked. Both arrived in excellent conditions, worked fine. The battery performance is not as new but it is to be expected. Around 30$to change it on Apple Store. The charger is not the original charger but I’m pleased to say that it is a very good one, it charges well enough and doesn’t looker feel cheap in anyway. The packaging was an afterthought, but it did include a printed 90 day refurbished warranty from amazon which is good. Overall, if you are looking for a good phone at a reasonable price, and you are willing to go with refurbished, I recommend you go with BuySPRY.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was working perfectly fine at first, but then it started loosing battery in like 15 minutes. I would be at 80% and then in another ten minutes of using the phone I would be at 20%. No matter what I do and even though I never over charge my phone, the phone’s battery life is horrible. I’m thinking of getting a battery replacement from apple which costs about $49. Also, there is no way for me to silent the camera noise. I’ve tried everything but it doesn’t work. Other than that, the phone was generally good, but what can you do with a dead phone?
<<&&&&>>
Will be returning. The battery life of this phone is about 1 hour of only moderate use.
<<&&&&>>
At this price point I am not necessarily surprised, but the touchscreen is a little off. It has a few "dead" spots that just don't work. It's not at a super important part of the phone, but it is quite annoying because it does effect scrolling. I'm hesitant to return it because it was so cheap and it works perfectly otherwise - but if it gets any worse I definitely am going to return it.
<<&&&&>>
We've had this phone for some time now, and it has performed just like a new phone for us. Looks great, works perfectly, battery life is fine. I'd buy this phone from this vendor again in a heartbeat. The iPhone 6s is a great little phone, even even if there are several generations newer out there. It has a quality feel and look, does everything a phone is supposed to do, and takes nice photos.
<<&&&&>>
Garbage!! first day battery wasn’t holding a charge so was told to buy a new battery and I would get reimbursed...till this date no refund! Then it just recently totally shut down! Didn’t even last a year!! Total waste of money! Contacted seller only response I got that it only comes with 90 day warranty! Never again will I buy from this seller!
<<&&&&>>
Physical condition is great. My battery life is not great. It reads “78% capacity” on the first day of use. They claim they are all 80% or better.
<<&&&&>>
Everything about the phone is in great shape (even the battery is new), but the home button is loose and has this annoying double-click that you can feel and hear when pushing it. It’s getting worse over time. I’m wondering if this issue is the original reason why the phone was returned. I don’t want to have to return the phone because I don’t have a backup phone anymore, and, I’m afraid the replacement would have a worse battery or be in worse cosmetic condition. I’m hoping the seller will reach out to me and work out a local repair so I don’t have to ship off the phone.
<<&&&&>>
We purchased this phone as our kid's first phone. The description of this item guarantees a battery health of at least 80%. Sure enough the battery health on the phone we received was 81%. But that's not so bad right? Ya no.. that's basically unusable. He's at 30% battery before he even gets to school with just a single hour of screen time. It miraculously lasts the school day and dies on the 30 minute bus ride home. I wanted this to ensure his safety.. we wanted to be able to GPS him and call him, but with this kind of battery life there is no way we can trust it to be available.
<<&&&&>>
The phone you receive may or may not be unlocked. I purchased two of these phones for my kids. We used them with wi-fi only for the last year, and when I purchased SIM cards from MintMobile to use in the phones, only one of them accepted it. The second phone displays the message “SIM Not Supported” and will not function with the SIM card inserted. I contacted the seller, but because I am outside of my return window they will not do anything to help me, even though they knowingly sold me a product that does not function as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
I have just had this phone for a few hours, but so far, I am pleased with my purchase. I was nervous about buying this, but I'm glad I did. The phone looks great--no scratches. It fully charged from zero in 45 minutes( this was while I was using it and installing things, so it might not take that long) I was able to connect it to T-Mobile right away using a SIM card from another phone. I was able to put apps and music on it, no problem. The camera works great. Phone calls are clear. I will update in a month or so to review battery life and durability--hopefully it will still be smooth sailing.
<<&&&&>>
I used it almost a week, everything goes well, except the poor battery life. I have to charge it more than two times a day. I am not sure if they really did the test for the battery health. The battery capacity of my phone does not have a minimum capacity of 80%.
<<&&&&>>
After owning this phone only 2 days the internal speaker stopped working. After the hassle of downloading all my data and changing over the SIM card, I decided to not return it. I took it to be repaired at the cost of $100 only after I had tried every trick offered on you tube.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is my second 6s, asI like taking them in the water (not). This product was a Certified Reconditioned phone, and so far has worked as expected, the physical condition was without flaw, scratch or dent, like new, packaged in a Apple box. I will know more about the stability of the IPhone after my 90 day warranty expires. This phone was priced right.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone from Kiss Electronics........ It was supposed to be fully unlocked but its locked. I work in Afghanistan and a colleague brought it out for me but its difficult to send the phone back.......... So, be warned, this is not a reliable company to buy from.
<<&&&&>>
Purchased from BuySPRY. Battery was not replaced as described (and only has 84% battery health compared to a new battery) so it barely lasts through my 20 minute morning commute. Home button spontaneously stops working. Sometimes phone will shut off randomly with plenty of charge and not turn back on. Visible scratches on the back, despite purchasing one that was supposed to look exactly like new. Overall very disappointed after just 2.5 months with this phone. Returning.
<<&&&&>>
The phone has a few problems, it doesn’t hang up, you have to power it off to end the call, also the speaker and keyboard option are not working when press on them, the voice of the caller is very noisy, and the battery doesn’t keep the charge for more than 2 hours, I usually charge it overnight, before bed, by the next morning, the charge drops down to 10%,
<<&&&&>>
Excellent value for price! I think refurbished items are fantastic and I would never pay full price . This is a great deal!
<<&&&&>>
It wasn't fixed like advertised. It was supposed to be certified refurbished. Nope. I never but then for exactly that reason. Maybe I created that experience. Should I try again with refurbished? How else to get an apple
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks wonderful and performs great but I’m really dissatisfied in the condition of the internal battery.... I thought I purchased a refurbished device, but really it’s just a used one that’s cosmetically in A condition. Now I have to spend $30 on a new battery and install it myself or drive an hour and a half to my nearest Apple store to get them to replace it...
<<&&&&>>
There are so many refurbished phones out there and without trying the individual phone every sale is a gamble. I purchased a 6s from this company rated in Excellent condition. It arrived and was just that. Like new . Everything works fine. 85% battery life left. Couldn’t be more pleased. I definitely would buy again.
<<&&&&>>
Phone did take a little longer to receive than expected but not a big deal. Came in a generic box with a generic lightning cable. No headphones. Phone itself looks great. Very little evidence of usage. Operates fine. However battery life is 80% at the recommended swap for a new one guideline from Apple. All in all it’s a pretty decent value for an unlocked iPhone 6s.
<<&&&&>>
The digitizer under the screen has a tear in it, giving the look of a blemished spot under the screen. The battery is toast out of the box. Phone loses 10% almost every half hour with minimal use. This is the first time I have ever bought anything that was “Certified Refurbished”, probably will be the last..
<<&&&&>>
The phone is great. The condition was not. "Certified to look and act like new". I don’t think so. More like scratch and dent, which is how it came. Had to immediately get the battery replaced. But, it works fine. Just would prefer a correct description.
<<&&&&>>
The battery on this phone was at 78% defective when I received it. I kept getting warnings from the Apple iphone that the battery was going bad. After a few attempts I convinced the sellers to let me have Apple install a new battery. The phone works great. I’m still waiting for refund they promised me. I emailed a copy of the receipt, haven’t received a thing...
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this refurbished phone from CertifiedDeals. I had an issue with the phone and CertifiedDeals jumped on the case, immediately sent me a voucher to send it back and once it was on the way they immediately sent me a new phone with the whole kit back. Thank you for a great service, 100% value for money and top service. I never had to return the product, the response from the seller was immediate including a tracking number to track the replacement phone. Needless to say that the replacement works perfect and I am a happy customer. Strongly recommend.
<<&&&&>>
Cosmetically, the device was flawless. Thus far, it operates flawlessly as well. I was nervous buying this device, but I’m glad I did. My carrier offered the same IPhone with less memory for more money.
<<&&&&>>
Love it. For anyone wanting to know, this phone did get activated with Boost Mobile just fine, only thing is you have to purchase a new SIM card but you keep your existing number. Battery drains a little bit faster than normal but the capacity is at 94% but I still plan on replacing it soon. Updates to newest iOS 12.2 software... nothing else wrong at all good price for storage size and phone came in great condition along with charger! Oh and came for free same-day shipping.
<<&&&&>>
In good condition. You can tell it was kept in a case. Dirt outlined the camera. Not a problem though. Works great. Only thing I don’t like is that it cost $30 more than the same exact one I got for my bf. the only difference in the 2 is mine is fully unlocked compared to his only GSM. His looked brand spanking new, but is also a refurbished. Mine came with a Mint mobile sim. I haven’t used it though.
<<&&&&>>
El equipo se calentaba bastante y precisamente después del mes de garantía dejó de funcionar y nadie lo pudo reparar, quedó inservible. No arriesguen su dinero !!!
<<&&&&>>
couldn't tell this phone has been "renewed." It works just fine and I have had no problems with it. The 6/6s is the same size as the 7 and 8 just for the people wondering.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived in great shape! Very easy to set up. On day 2 of using it my battery was at 20% after 4 hours at work! Has not been any better since either
<<&&&&>>
This phone would not turn on phone services- my phone company said the phone would not read the sim card and there's something wrong with the sim slot. Iphone 6s have this recall. Buyer beware- they do not check the phones to make sure they are working. Waste of time. Especially if you need a phone right away. You'll be running in circles and waiting forever for a refund. I am still waiting for my refund and it has been over a week now.
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone as an emergency replacement and although it doesn’t conserve battery very well, it has decent memory for all my apps and is compact with good features. Don’t feel like I am missing out much and don’t have to be doing monthly payments for a $1000 phone.
<<&&&&>>
Battery was weak and not holding a charge. Home button was dirty with caked on something. Port for cord was filled lint had trouble plugging it in to cord. Needed a phone that worked and did not have time wait for replacement. Went to a cell phone repair that I trust. He tested and replace the battery and cleaned out the charging port. Frustrating.
<<&&&&>>
I had my iPhone 5s, also refurbished, for 3 years now so I needed an upgrade. I bought this phone from Lonestar Mobile. It came in a proper packaging, even tho the phone could have been better packed. This iPhone is Verizon unlocked, so it works for both CDMA and GSM networks. Looks and works like new, no dents or scratches and everything works great so far. Paying $240 for a phone of this quality is worth it if you don't want the latest iPhone but something that does the trick!
<<&&&&>>
Bought with a doubt... Works perfect.. only defect is battery has problem.. drains quickly even though less usage
<<&&&&>>
I got this iPhone as an upgrade from 5s. It worked well. Exactly how I wanted. But the same day, it just died. Turned off and wouldn’t turn back on. No force restart or iTunes restore would help. Computer couldn’t even find it. It was like the battery got disconnected. But I sent it back and got a complete refund, and bought it again. That was about 3-4 months ago, and it’s still working right now. I recommend you get this product If you aren’t afraid of sending it back for a new one.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas so not sure about the overall preformance of the phone yet but it looks new and was easily added to my existing sprint account and seemed to work fine before I wrapped it.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t realize until it was too late that the maximum battery capacity is 77%
<<&&&&>>
I like everything about this phone, except it seems the battery doesn't last long enough.
<<&&&&>>
Works as expected, in great condition, battery life not that good but typical of a 2-3 year old 6s.
<<&&&&>>
Good iPhone in much better condition than I expected. Delivery took one day more than stated, but who cares? Sheesh, it's only one day.
<<&&&&>>
This phone isn’t fully unlocked like the ad says. When I got it the invoice says gsm unlocked, which is not what I wanted. I had to go to Verizon for them to tell me it isn’t usable for Verizon. Now I have to send it back
<<&&&&>>
For a 16GB phone it's just fine, however when your'e expecting a 64GB..... they are going to allow me to return this one, so like anything else, it'll all workout.
<<&&&&>>
Don’t be fooled by the reviews saying it worked with sprint! We just got back from sprint and they told us this phone is not compatible with sprint CDMA sig. We are hopeful our return goes smoothly and will look for a phone that is compatible.
<<&&&&>>
Came in near perfect condition. Amazing for the price. Battery life is a little used up, but more than enough to get through the day under heavy use (music, apps, videos).
<<&&&&>>
Great phone, I love it
<<&&&&>>
Phone had battery issues from the start but we just put up with it. Finally took it in to get a battery and it was diagnosed to have a bad motherboard - possibly stolen. This is 3 weeks after end of the return window closed - so a hard lesson learned about pursuing minor issues when buying.
<<&&&&>>
I just got the phone today was excited , until I put my sim in and when I tried to make calls or send text they dont go through ... it didn’t wanna let me download anything at first but I few times of restarting it .. the downloads were working... I’m very unhappy about the results I have , my phone bill is paid but I’m not able to use it ... this phone is useless I guess
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit worried to buy a used smartphone, but I am really happy with my 6s 64 GB. Everything works perfectly, looks almost like new, battery is almost like new and I am pleased with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Good used iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Phone was all good my only complaint is the cameras shutter sound can NOT bet turned off. Very annoying. Also if you are looking to buy this phone it says it works for Verizon but when I got the phone the paper inside said it might work with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
The item is good, the only thing that I was checking is that sometimes the phone is overheating, I was looking some forums and looks like this is normal (today I made and update to IOS 12 probably will works much better) just this, because all another things are working excellent without any problem.
<<&&&&>>
Battery life is really bad and I have to shut it of once in a while because the typing screen doesn’t show..
<<&&&&>>
Bought for my 11 year old. He has been very happy with it!
<<&&&&>>
The phone come LOCKED. I tried to unlock it and AT&T toll me that it has unpaid balance linked to your device!!! Unbelievable! How can AMAZON sells a product online that has got unpaid bill on it! What to do now?
<<&&&&>>
I love my iphone but the battery life is sucks
<<&&&&>>
a lot of problem，if you just want to buy a cheap cellphone，you can choose it
<<&&&&>>
Honestly I was very scared at first but then I was like it’s a risk you have to take. After getting it everything was up to date and reset. Everything worked perfect. All I ddI was called to change my sim and it worked great. idk yet cause I only had it for a day but I think it is ok
<<&&&&>>
My twins LOVE them!!
<<&&&&>>
I love the Apple phone because for me it is easy to understand and have a long battery life.
<<&&&&>>
still learning how to use it very pleased
<<&&&&>>
I really liked the phone, but it’s not really unlocked. I couldn’t register my phone on Verizon, had to use my old SIM card. Couldn’t put the phone on my insurance. The phone works great! Like brand new condition.
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone checked out battery, speakers, and touch screen! It was in excellent condition and was unlocked as it says! Definitely worth the money and will buy from here again!! Thanks
<<&&&&>>
Had for a couple months and quit. Won’t turn on just stays on APPLE screen. Super disappointed. When it did work battery ran down SOOOO fast.
<<&&&&>>
Amazing purchase! No scratches or even lines, the touchscreenreen without a trace nor even a fingerprint; the side bottoms were absolutely fine, so is the home bottom and the back front was clean! I would definitely buy again here!
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself seems to be in good shape. The touch screen works great. Has a few scratches on the screen. Battery is NO good. Maybe lasts 2 hours. Will not give a 5 star because of the battery.
<<&&&&>>
it was fully unlocked as advertised , and has worked fine for like a week but after the screen turned black but the phone is still on, doesn’t work
<<&&&&>>
Works well
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone. Has the click button. Absolutely no problem with it.
<<&&&&>>
This phone functions perfectly and exactly how it would if it was bought directly from apple
<<&&&&>>
I bought this item to replace my old phone. Its for sure great quality for money, the phone is in great conditions (only two weeks into it though) and works well. The only negative side is the battery life which is quite deteriorated. However, this is not a huge issue as you can change it in the Apple Store for 30 USD.
<<&&&&>>
Telephone arrived earlier than promised. It was exactly what I ordered. Switched the service from my old phone to this phone with AT&T no problem. Telephone works exactly as promised. There are a couple of glitches but I think they are in the apps and not in the telephone itself. All in all, I am very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
I was skeptical on buying a phone from amazon but so far I’m content. I bought from BUYSPRY and the phone quality was good! A couple of minor scratches but overall good! However, the speakers sounded muffled. As if the phone had been dropped in water.
<<&&&&>>
This phone has a problem. It is dying too shortly. If the battery 100% now in two hours it will die even you don’t use it at all. 👎I am going to return the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Might be a new screen and case but the innards might be old. The battery doesn’t seem to be new. It holds charge but drains quickly so far. Took a while to switch over to the newer phone. Apple makes it a pain.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is giving a lot of trouble bought it about 3 days now n the phone goes off and on. The battery shows 1% life. As I change it it has 77%. Dont know how people can sell defected iteams!!!
<<&&&&>>
Very good, exactly like described and fully unlocked for all carriers.
<<&&&&>>
The phone works great and looked new. The only thing one could complain about is the battery life of the phone which I suspect has nothing to do with the vendors but the manufacturer and the specific phone model. That said, the battery last for a day which is not too bad I guess.
<<&&&&>>
Phone works and looks like new. Battery was 3/4 charged, I inserted my SIM card, installed the latest backup from my previous phone, and it has been working perfectly since. Very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
I was very happy to replace my husband's favorite but broken phone with the one I bought here. It came quickly and looked brand new. It works great and we are very happy.
<<&&&&>>
Pretty good, except the baterry life.
<<&&&&>>
Received a pristine iPhone 6S and was surprised that the screen and body appeared brand new. I would’ve preferred that it had a new battery, as it only had a capacity of 81%, but for the price I’m very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
The headline says it all. I’ve emailed twice so far with no response. I can’t use the phone at all as it’s saying I can’t activate it as it’s still locked! Maybe this review will finally get a response from the seller.
<<&&&&>>
Sebastian, the phone is still registered to you. I can’t set up my voicemail. Very disappointed that this wasn’t fully unlocked as the advertisement said.
<<&&&&>>
This phone came in VERY poor condition! Serious scratches on the screen and aluminum back. On top of that, the package was late and the phone was on in the package.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is good and works with my Verizon sim card, the only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it included a phone case as a 'free gift' but the phone case was sticky and smelled like cough syrup. I washed it 3 times as the smell and stickiness wouldn't go away, I just had to throw it out.
<<&&&&>>
I’m using this phone right now to write this review, it’s great, works perfectly fine, nothings beat up or scratched ( except for the ones I made after getting it ) and really has no issues as far as I can tell.
<<&&&&>>
It’s as great as any I paid 5x the price for. No problems.
<<&&&&>>
the screen had glue, the cell phone came in a generic box and with a generic charger, not the original and the most important, I have Big issues, it is not working well, is very slow and looks like it has not the capacity for working well. I want to return it!’
<<&&&&>>
Received phone pretty quickly. Noticed right away that the mute switch doesn’t work properly. After I put it in service I discovered that the speaker doesn’t sound like it should it. But at least the software and battery seem to be working fine.
<<&&&&>>
Hmm came in chinese but figured it out
<<&&&&>>
I bought as a Christmas gift for my son whom always wanted this product... so far so good!! He is very pleased....
<<&&&&>>
Love it
<<&&&&>>
First one being returned, LTE didn't work and screen had a slight imperfection. Second one has no cosmetic damages, and seems to work like new. Battery is showing 89% efficiency, which is acceptable.
<<&&&&>>
Everything worked like it was brand new, and no flaws at all!
<<&&&&>>
Phone was great..the only problem was I didn’t realize that I needed a SIM card so it took a little longer for me to activate it but very happy with phone battery life isn’t great
<<&&&&>>
Always wanted a 6s and this one runs perfectly the battery isn’t the greatest then again that’s just because this phone has a small battery so but overall I’m extremely happy with my purchase
<<&&&&>>
El celular en sí funciona perfecto, pero tiene una falla en la Batería. Figura como mantenimiento y anda al 80% del original. Con la cámara o el parlante dura apenas unas horas. El resto, muy bien
<<&&&&>>
Wish I knew I needed SIM card in order to get Verizon to activate the cell service....had to wait additional days to receive the SIM card....otherwise, the phone looks great and I look forward to my upgrade from Iphone 4
<<&&&&>>
Muy buena condición
<<&&&&>>
I just love the Apple iPhone 6S <3 and get my battery life replace store by me =)
<<&&&&>>
Device arrived in good physical shape, with Lightning cable and genetic charger. However the battery health was 85%, so the battery doesn’t appear to be one of items refurbished.
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies in less than one hour after a full charge.
<<&&&&>>
Good reliable and exit my expectations. thank you to the vendor
<<&&&&>>
It shocked my face and then completely stopped working. They’re selling phones with bad wiring 🙄
<<&&&&>>
Renewed is not like refurbished, it still came a little scratched up. Original trash battery from the Apple scandal.
<<&&&&>>
The 6s seems to be fine but as reviews stated the battery capacity was 79%. After full charge battery lasted one day and that was with nominal usage.
<<&&&&>>
My son loves his phone
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with defective battery and it got bumped off the table and cracked before we could return it.
<<&&&&>>
My phone stopped working after a day of using. I have started return and I have sent the phone back to the seller but unfortunately I didn't receive any money back. Don't recommended !! Lost of money
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in great condition when it arrived. It was all I was hoping for... but I did notice that after the first couple day that the battery life wasn’t great.
<<&&&&>>
Great but battery life is at 83 % and two small white dots on screen. Overall ok for the $175 I paid. But would life new battery and screen
<<&&&&>>
When I got it work fine I got it upset up phone wouldn’t work so much for happy birthday to my husband 🙄
<<&&&&>>
Said phone was fully unlocked and it is not unlocked. Couldn’t use it.
<<&&&&>>
Personal
<<&&&&>>
The phone came as advertised at a very good price. It also came very quickly, earlier than expected.
<<&&&&>>
I had to replace battery cost me $50!
<<&&&&>>
Phone was defective. Would glitch and not let you do anything real piece of junk
<<&&&&>>
Battery Life not chargeable at all. Bought a new battery that was not the issue. This phone isn’t usable.. wasted my money...
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in great condition. It came in original box with a screen protector, charger, and cable. I was only expecting the phone in a box. The phone has been running great with no issues.
<<&&&&>>
It does everything it is supposed to do. I am well pleased with it . It was all that the seller said it would be.
<<&&&&>>
I like the breathe of uses.
<<&&&&>>
the phone worked good but the charge was not lasting. they replaced it right away, the replacement works great and stays charged.
<<&&&&>>
As described. Not a scratch.
<<&&&&>>
Super nice product. It works great, and fast. The touch screen works perfectly. There were no scratches on the screen or the back! Great birthday gift.
<<&&&&>>
Battery has a 2 hr life when not used minutes in use Shuts off unexpectedly. Appearances and functions normal as should
<<&&&&>>
Phone was totally dead when I received it. After full charge battery does not even last a full day. Battery needs replaced.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent product
<<&&&&>>
Performed well right out of the box. Have had no problem
<<&&&&>>
I’ve only had this phone for about a month and the screen went blue and now I have to pay more money to get it fixed. I haven’t dropped it or cracked it or anything. It’s in perfect condition and the screen is a tint of blue
<<&&&&>>
Looked bad. Ended up returning.
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies with in 5 mins after full charge, turns off unexpectedly and it seems to me it’s refurbished very poorly
<<&&&&>>
Excelente condiciones en cuanto a su funcionalidad, todo Ok

<<&&&&>>
Not a bad product I like it overall no scratches very good condition except for the fact that my phone isn’t unlocked
<<&&&&>>
I was very apprehensive about ordering a refurbished phone, but I am so glad I did. The iPhone 6s arrived and was in perfect condition. It took me about 10 min. to set it up. I couldn't be happier!!!
<<&&&&>>
Great phone works and looks like new I recommend
<<&&&&>>
The company guaranteed 80% battery life. Mine came out of the box with only 72%. I do not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
Battery was defective. Item returned.
<<&&&&>>
This was supposed to be Verizon compatible but it was not. Don’t be fooled
<<&&&&>>
Very good !!

So far I do like everything about the phone.
<<&&&&>>
The battery life is so bad, you have to charge it at least 10 times a day..
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>

Si.. llegó a tiempo

My phone came a few issues but I do realize that this might have just been a bad one that I received. 1. The phone is pretty beat up all the way around the edges. Not a big deal to me as I assume this is a used phone and a case covers it anyways. 2. The battery is completely shot. The percentage will drop more than 50% within an hour of just browsing the internet. This will cause me to need to pay $30 to get it replaced. 3. It also seems to have trouble charging when connected to a car. I have to restart the phone for it to start charging properly. 4. The speaker is pretty busted as well. When playing sound or talking on the speaker you can hear a lot of static. 5. The touch screen seems a little wonky. These issues have been frustrating and I will probably return the phone soon and order another one. Hopefully one without so many issues.
<<&&&&>>
The phone mechanics are in very good order. The battery seems fine as does the OS. The charging port is still tight and the buttons click effectively like ON/OFF and Volume. However the screen is well used. In my experience with refurbs they always replace the screen. This one has wear. Sort of like buying a really mechanically sound used car whose paint is melted off and the seller ignored it. It is a 64gb phone so its an ok deal. A screen that didn't suck would make it four or five stars. Really odd because the camera lens appears to be new and if you opened it for that why not replace the glass. Used an otter box with a wireless charger. The ballistic otter box and wireless charger go well together and the phone charges fine. Also , these refurb places only give you ninety days.....I HIGHLY recommend the added protection. Amazon sells a pretty much no hassle added protection plan and since the seller isn't more confident in their work, GET IT.
<<&&&&>>
I've always been an android user, but pressure from my adult son convinced me to make an iPhone my next device. Because it was a certified factory refurbished 6S, it certainly appeared to be brand spanking new in every way. After two months of use, I have had no problems whatsoever with it. That said, and as a long time android user, I still can't understand why Apple still hasn't decided to put the period, comma and numbers on the same page with all the lower case letters when texting. When I asked my son if that wasn't an inconvenience to him, his reply was, "Well, I've always owned Apple phones and always took it for granted that to punctuate or enter numbers, you have to go to another screen to select them." So, for all the Apple users out there, It's a great phone for the money, and if you're an android user, you've got some re-learning to do.
<<&&&&>>
i was really surprised bc i ahve had great luck with purchasing reconditioned iphones on amazon. this is the first time i ahve had to buy one under their new "renewed" policies. so far i'm not impressed. Unlocked iphones 6s was purchased from WirelessWarehouse USA. i sent it back today after 3 days of trying to figure out wtf conclusion: the battery was a complete dud even thought the battery health screen says 87% took 6 hours to charge to full took an hour to empty completely without running any apps the battery health screen said the homescreen was the most used app the home screen! followed the various instructions online to ge the most out of your iphone 6s batter incl soft & hard reset, etc. nothing the only way to get he battery to last more than an hour, whether i was running apps or not, was to keep it on airplane mode. i returned it. will try my luck with another vendor.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was as I expected. Came in a generic box with charger and cable. It was also unlocked. Because of other reviews, I thought I would put it through its paces before I commit to transferring to this phone. WiFi and Bluetooth were the first test and did great. I updated the OS and then transferred my old phone content over to the new phone. Everything transferred without an issue. I then updated all the apps and that also went as expected. The final step was to add this phone to my Xfinity Mobile account and transfer my T-Mobile pay as you go number over to this phone. It all went fine, after giving the operator the IMEI number from the phone, and the information to transfer my number over. After about 15 minutes the service was moved over to my new phone. I had some concerns after reading other mixed reviews. But I think the other reviews are correct. It may be about whom you purchase it from. I purchased from BuySPRY. The only thing I was not able to test at this point is the battery life but I expect it to be good as well. REMEMBER to include who you purchased from in your review so we can identify the bad sellers from good.
<<&&&&>>
We have sort of adopted my 17 yr old daughter's boyfriend, so when the iphone 6s that he was using (which was a hand me down from my daughter) died after having a soda spilled on it, I came to Amazon to try to find a replacement. With mixed reviews, it's hard to know who to trust, but when I found one through Amazon Renewed, I jumped on it. Amazon has stringent guidelines for their approved vendors, so I knew it would be good. Yes it was $20 more than some of the other phones, but it seriously looks, and works like brand new!
<<&&&&>>
I am that guy who thinks his iPhone 4s is a perfectly good piece of technology and still works, so why replace it? I proudly showed off my obsolete phone to my students who enjoyed teasing me about it. I finally took the plunge (upgrading from 8 year old technology to 4 year old technology - not the biggest plunge I suppose). Had to get a new SIM card since the old phone had a micro and the 6s needed a nano (don't even try to cut a micro down). This phone is incredible, finally allowing me to graduate from 3G and take advantage of things like WiFi assisted calling, bigger screen, apps that I can actually use, etc. And, as of now anyway, is still "modern" in that it is supported by the latest iOS release. This particular "renewed" phone arrived on time in excellent condition, had no blemishes or scratches that I could see, and has a battery life of 91%. **Very** happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Seriously, when you buy a phone thats been "factory refurbished" you expect it to work for more than 4 months. In my experience this DID NOT happen, the seller Kanga Supply Co took zero responsibility for my issue with the phone telling me to contact apple because they have a "strict" 90 day warranty. The phone will not take a charge, the charging port is trash after 3 months and phone does not stay charged. STAY AWAY from this seller, will never buy from them again complete trash phone unbelievably lame and unreliable phone if i could i would give this seller and their product ZERO stars.
<<&&&&>>
I brought this item, after doing full charge, battery gone down within 2 hrs to less than 10 hours. It sucked. Battery health shows 100% but not even last for 2 hrs. I talked with Amazon, and apple customer support, but apple tech ran few diagnostics doing screen share, and said this battery is 4 years old and should be replaced and he was also amazed that battery health showing 100%, wow they are just making you fool. Don’t go for it.
<<&&&&>>
Don’t buy this phone. Find another source for a used phone. It arrived with a battery that was no good. We could not wait to exchange it so we went to the Apple store and had a new battery put in. About two weeks later, the battery was draining quickly. There were also many other problems with the phone. We took it back to the Apple store who told us it was failing all over the place internally. Complete hassle to attempt to get a working phone. Definitely wouldn’t recommend his supplier.
<<&&&&>>
Was delightfully surprised to get a phone with no scratches or dents. Looks new. Battery was discharged. After charging it up the battery health indication was 87% and the iOS 11.3.1. Had to update it and my old iPhone to the latest iOS to transfer the restore. Used iTunes and this went well. Battery health is now 85%. All functions on this phone are in working order.
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself looks great, little to no scratches and so far screen touch and brightness is good. I have yet to even activate the phone as I need to go buy a SIM card since this one did not come with one and I am already noticing that the battery life is terrible. Within two minutes of just scrolling through the settings the life drops 10%. With a battery life like this you will probably have about a half hour of use before the phone dies. In other words it’s not even useable! Do not recommend purchasing.
<<&&&&>>
If I could put 0 stars, I would. Very short battery life, had to charge 4 times in one day and barely used it. The volume control doesn’t work at all. This is the third phone I’ve purchased through this buyer, first two were great, third had to send back. Also there was a burned spot in the screen. No problem on returning though.
<<&&&&>>
Refurb was as new, but screen slow to respond occasionally. And languages don’t always hold. May just be a 6s glitch
<<&&&&>>
When the phone came it was in good condition. Better than my previous iPhone 6s that I got and dropped a while back. My only issue is that when this phone is doing a lot st once, the peak capacity drops below normal and shuts off. I am considering getting a replacement battery from apple, but it isn’t too much of a problem. Good job, Refurbisher!
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself seems almost like a new unit. I was very pleased with this purchase and the seller shipped it one day earlier than expected.
<<&&&&>>
I took this phone to my local Sprint store to add a line to my account. They were not able to activate because the phone was not unlocked as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
It says in the description that the battery will have at least 80% capacity. The one I bought says its 74% and that the battery is "significantly degraded". Ive bought two of these now. I returned the first one for the same reason just to get one that is worse. The battery will lose 20-40% in about 20 minutes of using a gps map app. Frustrating.
<<&&&&>>
Great price. Audio is the phone speaker is terrible. This is the replacement because the first one had screen imperfections. Lately it’s been kicking off the internet and not staying connected to WiFi.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived promptly, actually earlier then when originally ordered. Hard to tell the difference from a new phone and also included a new screen protector. No issues with the phone and happy with the purchase
<<&&&&>>
Bought to replace an old iPhone 6S. The screen cracked only in a couple of weeks after a mild fall from knee-height with the protective case on. You get what you pay for—a refurbished item wouldn’t be able to handle physical impact like a brand new product would.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in great conditions. A few minor scraches but the display was in perfect condition, even had a screen protector on it. The batery said 87% capacity but it would run down fast. Only will cost me about $20 do buy a new one and replace it myself. Will buy again.
<<&&&&>>
Looked and worked like new when received. Very happy with phone until last month when battery life was diminishing very quickly. Now drains after a couple of hours. Expect a little more battery life after owning phone for just 4 months, at least a year would have been nice.
<<&&&&>>
After reading reviews I started getting nervous😯 but everything changed when I got phone, Phone looks almost new no dents on it and came with screen protector also no scuffs on sides only thing it does not come with apple charger and head phones but besides that phone looks awsome nothing negative about phone so far
<<&&&&>>
Got this phone and it looked pretty good - practically new - BUT - Battery died out quickly - couldn't get signal most of the time - oy!! Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this!
<<&&&&>>
Came in great condition no scratches, flawless. Arrived with screen protector and off brand cable and charger. Battery was at 84%, replaced at apple for 30 dollars.
<<&&&&>>
I’m very happy with this purchase! It works well and there were no faults or imperfections on the screen.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is great for a kid and it's compatible with Xfinity mobile! Just about to purchase got my other son!
<<&&&&>>
John really likes his new phone. It is bigger than his old phone so he can type and read messages so much easier. There are things he is still learning to do but I think this phone is going to be great for him.
<<&&&&>>
This arrived exactly as described! Excellent condition and I activated in minutes. It also came with a screen protector, no dents or scratches. Just got it and very happy about it. Will update if anything changes
<<&&&&>>
Condition of the phone was amazing! You would’ve thought it was new, wow! Not a single blemish anywhere.
<<&&&&>>
This my first smart phone. Its a big jump into the 21st century.
<<&&&&>>
Wow, only been a day but very impressed with the quality of this iPhone. iPhone 5s died and I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a new one. Works flawless with Verizon wireless.
<<&&&&>>
The battery is poor. When buying a refurbished phone, I would expect to get anew battery, not one that is worse than my old phone. Disappointed 😢
<<&&&&>>
Like new
<<&&&&>>
Gave to friend
<<&&&&>>
NOTE Refurbished - Batteries are not replaced if they are above 80% maximum capacity. 20% of a battery capacity is a big deal.
<<&&&&>>
I like referbishred stuff that is Big improvement on the actual I 6 s
<<&&&&>>
Bought this August 15 2018 it stopped working Sept 28 2018. Will not turn on.
<<&&&&>>
Works great
<<&&&&>>
Buyer beware. The phone worked, but the battery was already down to 80% useage. There were also some pixels on the screen that were nOT working.
<<&&&&>>
I was not happy with this purchase
<<&&&&>>
The phone works great except the battery life is terrible. I have to charge the phone at least 2-3 times a day to keep it from dying, even on airplane mode. At some point I’ll have to take it to Apple to get a new battery installed.
<<&&&&>>
Mobile is gettIng hot while charging and it’s discharging in few hours. Delivery was delayed by 2 days than what was promised after couple of follow ups.
<<&&&&>>
The phone delivered had a very much used battery. Apple battery health is showing 84% capacity, which is severely low. This has prompted Apple to disable peak performance. As a customer, I am dissatisfied that the refurbished phone didn’t have a battery in good health.
<<&&&&>>
Incredible for the price practically brand new. Battery life is not the best but for the price it’s a great buy!
<<&&&&>>
Arrived in perfect condition. Extremely pleased!
<<&&&&>>
Complaints with the battery
<<&&&&>>
Very good phone
<<&&&&>>
So far so good. No issues.
<<&&&&>>
Replaced my old iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Thank verygood good
<<&&&&>>
The unit arrived in excellent appearance. The problem was the volume of the earpiece, volume was low and I couldn't change it. The voice to text was awful. Breed authorized a return immediately. Now to see how quickly they refund my payment.
<<&&&&>>
Totally worth the price works even better than ones I have bought in store I will and continue to shop on amazon
<<&&&&>>
This was a gift for a neighbor girl who is ATTACHED to her phones. This is her 3rd one in 2 years, she just burns them out, she never is anywhere including the bathroom without a phone. Her parents won't pay for such a thing, so she works for me doing stuff like walking dogs and sweeping porches to pay it off over months- anyway, this one came, and it was PERFECT, the screen was clear, no cracks, no dings, no anything- looked new. It worked right out of the box, it was rose gold, and very pretty. She is in love with it, and the seller was spot on in the description, it was factory serviced and mostly reasonably priced considering what a new Iphone costs...she begged me to buy her a marble case and protector screen and she is on her way...good job by seller
<<&&&&>>
I was really skeptical about buying a refurbished phone because I know people who have had horrible experiences with them but this phone was next to perfect! It was delivered on time, I received a charger also and it was fully unlocked as described. Tiny scratch mark on the side but it is almost unnoticeable. Battery life great, camera and sound all great. I’m extremely satisfied with this purchase. Btw this isn’t a paid review, real person, real experience!
<<&&&&>>
I was sooooo nervous getting this phone (as you are now😂) but I’ve had just about 2 1/2 wks and I have NOT had one issue with this phone. Discription of this phone is EXACTLY what it says! I received the phone fully unlocked I was able to add it to my carrier (Cricket) with NOOOOOOOO ISSUES!!!! This phone was worth every penny!!! And it came sooner than what was told to me!!!
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had this phone since May 2018 & i waited a couple months of use to give a honest review. Honestly, this phone is the best thing ever! At first, I was very skeptic about the phone because of the price and i thought it wasn’t compatible to Verizon (which it is :) ) UPS brought it a day early to me. I’ve had ZERO problems with this device. The ONLY downside to this phone is the Battery Life but all iPhones batteries are kinda sucky :( but as long as you have it on “Low Battery Mode” the battery life should last. Im very glad I made this purchase. I’m keeping this phone until I get my finances up to get a phone on contract (i’m a college student lol)
<<&&&&>>
So I was super worried seeing some reviews from other refurbished iPhones but my daughter really wanted one for her birthday so I decided to give it a go. The phone arrived in beautiful condition basically brand-new looking no scratches on the screen plastic over the screen just gorgeous. It is definitely fully unlocked as we are using it on Cricket service. I am 100% satisfied if you are looking into buying a refurbished iPhone I would recommend this company!
<<&&&&>>
This is only my second review I have ever written, maybe it the culmination of recent poor customer experience events or the stress of the season but hearing from my carrier thst this phone is not unlocked I felt compelled to notify others. Heed the previous warnings from other reviews. This company seems to have a pattern of shipping locked phones. Poor quality control to let this happen repeatedly. If you want to roll the dice, go for it.. However it you could be playing the returns game.
<<&&&&>>
My wife loved the iPhone, but next time we will buy new....too many hassles to get a refund even though it is guaranteed for 90 days.
<<&&&&>>
this is exactly what you'd expect from a refurbished phone. i got the rose gold one and it came in very good condition, no scratches or dents. the battery life is decent, it holds a charge for the most part but dies when its anywhere from 1-10% battery life. sometimes i will be on 7% and my phone will die and not turn on until i plug in again. however, with refurbished iphones (especially iphone 5's and 6's), that is to be expected. in general i would purchase this again if i needed a new phone. my verizon sim card works with it. i have purchased multiple refurbished iphones from this site and this is the best one yet.
<<&&&&>>
Reviews were mixed so I thought I would leave one. The one that arrived 2/27/2019 was CDMA unlocked I successfully added the device to my Verizon account from home. Popped in my Verizon sim card and it works perfectly. Battery is at 85% (about what you would expect from a lightly used Apple phone). You can put the ID number right into the Verizon website to see if it will work. Mine showed up as non Verizon iPhone. Hope this helps. Some of the reviews say this is not a CDMA phone. Took a chance and it is indeed CDMA unlocked.
<<&&&&>>
loved how the iPhone came looking very under used and it performs very well also. The only problem i ran into was battery life, if you're a millennial like i am then this phone probably isn't well suited for you. i say that because if you're constantly using social media you'll need to consistently charge your phone.
<<&&&&>>
No scratches or knicks. Everything is working fine and AT&T was able to cut my old Motorola SIM card to fit in the iphone. Transferring everything was very simple with the AT&T app. The only issue I’ve had was the battery life. It shut off twice when it was at a low percentage but the phone sent me a notification the second time saying it was correcting the issue. I usually have to charge the phone twice a day. Definitely worth $210 tho.
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself was good: the screen was in good condition and there were only a few nicks here and there. However, after calling Virgin Mobile (which is under Sprint), I was told the phone was not compatible with my provider. Very disappointed. If it doesn't work with CDMA carriers, don't put that in the description.
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new, battery is good, fully unlocked .It doesn’t comes with the original charger. 9/10
<<&&&&>>
Phone came looking and working like it was brand new. It was fully unlocked and wiped. No issues getting it set up. Battery life is as expected. No scratches. Camera works great.
<<&&&&>>
I checked 'Settings/Battery/Battery Health(Beta)', which said " Your battery's health is significantly degraded." I bought a "Refurbished" iPhone, and expected its battery was good, but it wasn't.
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked very well
<<&&&&>>
I wish I could give 0 star review. DO NOT BUY IT!!! I really needed the phone and it came all defective, when I try to call someone the main screen starts blinking and I can’t disconnect it or hang up, it will just keep rinoand eventually go to voicemail and I’m still not able to disconnect it. a WASTE OF TIME!
<<&&&&>>
Since I received this phone, I have had to charge it multiple times a day. From 100% the phone is down to 1% in about an hour and a half, two hours max. I checked the battery section under settings and find that the battery health is “significantly degraded”. Great. I have owned this phone for just a few months and I can’t go anywhere without having it plugged into a portable charger, which is cumbersome and a hassle. I am completely disappointed. I would give this zero stars if I could.
<<&&&&>>
For a long time I considered iPhone as a gimmicky status thing. It was time to buy a new phone and decided to try one since my adult son has one and has had it for years! He's is in the military and works with electronics and computers a lot so he knows what is good! I bought the same model as his and I absolutely love it! It's taking some use to get adapted to the different features and menus but overall it's a keeper!
<<&&&&>>
Came quickly & looks ok, however Amazon guarantees at least 80% Battery life & this has 75%. And it doesn’t seem to hold a charge very long, which is why I was giving up my iPhone 5....I researched getting a battery replacement from Apple using the serial number and found that the battery has Already been replaced on this phone! I’m not sure what I’ll do about returning it as I’m traveling for the next month & wont be home to deal with it-Figures. Amazon says “90 day Returns” so I hope this is true. Disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
For the price I think it’s a great phone except for two design flaws. The power button is on the side of phone where you hold phone. Too easily pushed. All too often turning phone off while using it with minimal pressure. Also switch to turn off ringer same problem. Actual performance of phone though is great
<<&&&&>>
Came perfect. Bought this for my grandmother because she wanted to join team iPhone. I think she’ll be super pleased.
<<&&&&>>
Battery is draining very fast (I hate the most) and back camera is not good. Even my iphone6 is having good picture quality. Phone doesnt look new.
<<&&&&>>
good price, everything is very good. the only downside is it loses battery fast, but one you charged it , it fills up fast too... so that kinda make up for it. my phone is still working now. and they are very good with their return policy. if you want a cheap iphone this is something you should consider!
<<&&&&>>
The battery is not working properly on this phone. It does very quickly and needs to be charged at least 2-3 times daily. Other than that the screen and other button are in good shape with a few scratches and dents.
<<&&&&>>
When I got it the sound was really quiet when I tried to watch videos or play music. A few weeks ago the speaker went really quiet when I tried to talk to people on the phone so it’s very hard to hear. The battery life sucks and I constantly have to charge it. When I contacted the sellers they said the 90 day warranty had expired so could not return. Would NOT buy again.
<<&&&&>>
Will never purchase from this seller again! It came late (2.5 weeks late) FILTHY, and definitely not refurbished!!! Poor quality and it put me in a bind for my daughter’s birthday!
<<&&&&>>
When my phone came in, the first issue I noticed was that the rear camera was severely damaged. Every time I would take a picture the edges of the screen would be severely blurred to the point to where I just never use that camera anymore. The phone also arrived with several cracks already in the screen. I took it to an apple shop to get it appraised and it was worth a measly 50 dollars in comparison to the over 200 I spent. Complete and utter waste of money
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone looking for a better camera and then I went to take my first picture I hear a shutter sound and try to figure out how to get rid of it. You can’t it is from japan that forces you to have a shutter you have to jailbreak your phone to get rid of it. I just wish I would have been warned of this and I want a different one without or a complete refund
<<&&&&>>
Purchased this last month simply because i needed to upgrade my phone ad i honestly love it , I've always loved apple products because they are high quality and long lasting. I think i may purchase another one for my mother for the holidays as a gift. It was easy to load my sim card and all of my apps and info took about 10 minutes.
<<&&&&>>
This phone itself was good quality but the battery life was awful. I needed a phone or else I would’ve sent it back
<<&&&&>>
Still has plastic on it. No dents nor scratches. I love it... it is unlocked. Haven't tried making a call to hear how the speakers work, because it's a gift for someone, I will let them tell me. But i am satisfied with my item!
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks brand spanking new, battery life is at 87% of new, so all in all a great risk to have taken!
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone. It was giving me a problem since buying. Battery shows 20% suddenly changed to 1% and then shut down. I change again to 100% but 2-3 hours shutdown again. After few months phone is shutting down (very frequently) even after 100% battery. So the bottom line: this phone is not very reliable, especially if you are traveling
<<&&&&>>
The product came in and was gernally in good quality, just with a slight light spot on the top of the screen. The issue I had, however, was with the battery life. The phone came in with the battery health at under 70%, and the phone loses battery at an incredible rate.
<<&&&&>>
Unexpectedly poor phone. Family is on the same plan with the same iPhone 6s. However, my gps and data cuts out unexpectedly while theirs remains strong. Completely frustrated with this phone. Would not recommend this seller
<<&&&&>>
I've purchased 2 of these phones from this seller for my 2 youngest sons (teens) and they are happy with them so I'm happy! Thanks a lot!
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks great works great curretly using it to make this review. I haven’t charged it letting it die but have gotten 6 hours on a red bar. The screen had a protector and the housing was in great shape. Sd card fit right in.
<<&&&&>>
I don't like smartphones, but finally was forced to buy one. I wanted a Samsung, but this refurbished Apple product had a reasonable price for a first time smartphone. Nothing fancy and it has been easy to use and navigate. Great color and lightweight. Excellent photo and video quality. Fast delivery!
<<&&&&>>
Total garbage. Cannot access your voicemail. Freezes constantly. Never buying refurbished product again!!! And cant even return this junk.
<<&&&&>>
The overall phone is okay. However the battery life sucks. The phone goes dead extremely fast. I took it to the apple store and they stated that the battery was at 80 percent and still had battery life. They stated that when the battery life hits 85 plus then the battery will need to be replaced. This is a apple 6 so I don't expect a lot. However I do wish the battery could had been already renewed. The condition of the phone is good, and so was the quality. I only have problems with the battery.
<<&&&&>>
Yes I was paranoid when I was looking through comments, but I’m thankful there’s a 90 day return policy if for any reason this thing gives up on me. When I got it It was easy to set up, the home button was responsive. Camera is clear and everything works like it’s brand new! Only thing is the battery requires some charging here and there but if you use your phone a lot that’s just a fact of these phones.
<<&&&&>>
I love this phone was right color as well charged quickly and hold charge well and was open for Metro T-Mobile service ,no SIM card came along with it but used my SIM card from my LG,However after a month the volume went out in my phone no ringtone coming out speaker and no it’s not set on silent it’s the phone it’s self !!!!🤦🏽‍♀️
<<&&&&>>
I have had my phone for a week now . So far it’s perfect. Not a scratch or dent anywhere. So far it runs perfectly. Will keep updated if anything changes.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my daughter. She loves it! It is in great condition and it looks like new. This product was guaranteed 80% battery life according to the product description, but only has 76%. This was not noticed until after I paid the Verizon activation fee, so I don't want to return it for a replacement to avoid paying another activation fee. At least I can always find my 12 year old daughter … she is never too far from an outlet.
<<&&&&>>
Looked new with no visible scratches. It also functions as a new phone. I’ve had this phone for a month and never had any issues with it. It came completely unlocked so it worked great with my local sim. Would recommend this purchase to anyone.
<<&&&&>>
After a month and a week the phone stopped working . Very disappointed
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my child for X-mas. Initially battery ran down very quickly. In less than a month it would not charge at all. I had a new battery installed, still will not charge. Basically bought a $200 paperweight. This is why I phone are only for spoiled children and rich people.
<<&&&&>>
Good value for a refurbished phone. Phone looks great, don't see any cosmetic wear. Battery life works well for me. I don't chat that much on the phone. I don't have any problems with the phone. Customer service is great. I got my phone one day before the expected date of arrival. I would recommend buying from this seller.
<<&&&&>>
My phone dies within 3 hours and the proximity sensor doesn’t work. ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID! Very upset with the product
<<&&&&>>
Seemed to work fine as I was setting it up, but not long after the bottom half of the screen started glitching- keyboard was going crazy switching back and forth and apps would open on their own or things pressed on their own. Cleaned the screen, made sure nothing was on my hands and restarted multiple times, but it still happened. Going to try and get an exchange and hopefully the next one is fine.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is in a really good condition and works perfectly. I bought one for my mom and ended up buying another one for my grandmother.
<<&&&&>>
Bought for my granddaughter but had to return. It was faulty.
<<&&&&>>
I was so happy to get the phone but then I take it to have it hooked up and the phone is already on a plan so I can't use it you would think they would check this stuff before putting it up for sale.
<<&&&&>>
I hate this phone be on belief. The storage sucks. They prompt you to pay constantly for their upgrades. If I didn't actually need this phone I would run it over with my car.
<<&&&&>>
I have received i phone 6s today which is just joke! At first phone getting restarted itself and it happening continuously! The screen is not working! It has a lot of scratches! It’s totally worthless . It has smells which is melted and repaired screen! I am so disappointed!
<<&&&&>>
iPhone - MyPhone. Greatest device. I love the security system that Apple provides. If you want privacy, you can go for it.
<<&&&&>>
Fue un regalo para mi sobrina en Venezuela y trabajo bien
<<&&&&>>
Everything's good until now except battery life(78%). This unlocked phone is good working in Korea.
<<&&&&>>
The battery’s life sucks, luckily I know how to fix I iPhones
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  The iPhone it came on time, came very neat it only had 1 minor scratch by the speaker but the rest of the iPhone is in great condition also included a temper glass awesome no needed to buy one👌🏼.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered an unlocked iPhone 6s in rose gold, I received an iPhone 6s in silver as well as NOT unlocked so cannot be used. Shipping was fast, but that doesn't matter when you receive the wrong product that has possible technical issues.
<<&&&&>>
DD’s phone was on battery vapors :( so this phone was perfect for her. She’s had it for 1 1/2 months with no complaints.
<<&&&&>>
Do not waste your time. Phone shuts off. Battery lasts an HOUR
<<&&&&>>
Suri was a little confused at first. Had so reboot a couple times!
<<&&&&>>
Product says it’s “fully unlocked” but it’s not, do not buy this it’s just a waste of time and money.
<<&&&&>>
You would think it would be legit if it’s sold on Amazon right? I guess that’s not always the case. When I received the phone the screen was holding on for its life, and the battery was bulging, almost as if it grew. I’m pretty sure that’s not normal, and at this point I’m just hoping I get my money back.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone to send it to the Caribbean for my brother birthday and the ear pice is not working properly also the volume is low, but it already in the Caribbean so I can return it back so next time I am not going to buy refurbished items learn my lesson.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my business. It works great. Cost effective. Best decision will buy more!
<<&&&&>>
They came in great condition, no scratches or anything. Though the battery life is a bit low it’s not that bad.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and gave it as a gift to my mom and the battery would not hold a charge. She had to go to the apple store and buy a new battery which cost her $50. I would like some type of refund on this defective item. I cannot return this since it was given as a gift.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was a piece of trash. Battery was shot, sensitive screen and the charger only worked at certain positions. Only reason I kept it was the price but I got some (another $100+) problems fixed. Definitely do your research into the company selling. They probably buy their reviews to be honest just be aware, they suck.
<<&&&&>>
I Started To Like The Phone At First But Now I Dislike It . The Battery Is Trash , The Volume Is Trash , The Phone Is Just Trash In General . My Phone Keeps Telling Me I Have No Sim So I Have To Keep Turning My a Phone On And Off Just To Get My Service Back On . I Will Never Order This Phone Again . Waste Of Money .
<<&&&&>>
I was really afraid of buying this phone and I kept my fingers crossed hoping that it automatically works with my network carrier and it finally came today I put in my SIM card and it worked The phone came like new sound and everything works perfectly for now I definitely would recommend this buyer
<<&&&&>>
Battery life is horrible price was okay for the phone it did come near perfect no scratches or cracks.
<<&&&&>>
I like the phone but I am so disappointed about the sound on it, it’s very quiet even when all the way up and the batteries life doesn’t even last all day even if it just sits on my desk at work if I knew I could return this phone and get it replaced with something that has longer battery and better sound I’d do that but idk if I’ll get that with new replaced phone over all phone is ok
<<&&&&>>
Works amazing. Hooked up to cricket wireless and loving it
<<&&&&>>
This iphone was everything it was promised to be. It was perfect, there were no scratches or dings in it. The battery life is wonderful and according to my daughter, who is a long time iphone user, this phone performs exactly as it should. Buying refurbished phones can be a crap shoot but do the homework and find a reliable seller.
<<&&&&>>
Battery life sucks but great phone otherwise
<<&&&&>>
Overall decent phone. No noticeable scratches/defects. The battery is bad (at 79% capacity) and not good for gaming / even binging youtube videos since the phone heats up. Good for basic functions... But no one buys a fancy phone nowadays for basic functions...
<<&&&&>>
This phone works as it should. No problems so far
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and gifted to one of relative. I came to know that battery drains with in 20 mins. I am feeling very bad I gifted such worthless product I gifted. I bought many products from Amazon and now this incident impacted me very bad.
<<&&&&>>
My 1st one was stolen and I have a watch so I had to replace it. It’s perfect.
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone as a backup. It is quite capable in its role.
<<&&&&>>
Works great! My mom loves it
<<&&&&>>
I purchased a refurb unit from Blutek. I am thoroughly satisfied. The display glass is flawless and the battery is at maximum capacity. It came with an aftermarket power adapter and no headphones. Besides that, my unit is basically brand new. Highly recommended buying through Blutek.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was ok but after a week of using has a lot of issues
<<&&&&>>
I doubt it was refurbished , the battery had only 75 % life in it and charger plug was loose
<<&&&&>>
Excellent phone for the price. Thanks
<<&&&&>>
it wouldnt let me make calls using my number instead it would use my email like and iPod. Don't buy this product it isn't 100% guaranteed that you will get a good phone. Biggest waste/ rip off ever.
<<&&&&>>
La batería no dura
<<&&&&>>
8 days in and already doesn't work properly. There are vertical white lines across the entire screen, which I believe is a hardware issue. Returning.
<<&&&&>>
I just got it today and it looks brand new for a refurbished phone. It was easy to transfer everything from my iPhone 5s to this one after putting my SIM card in. The box was torn up really bad, but the phone was safe in the smaller box that it was in.
<<&&&&>>
Nice design
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone (iphone6) a few months ago and I have to do this review because of how satisfied I am. Though I had to return the first one i got, the customer service reps were really helpful and I finally got this phone which has been serving its purpose very well. battery life is good. charger is great. phone is clean.
<<&&&&>>
Please dont buy this product. Even this product is apple certified it has lots of issues. Feom day one i am facing battery issue. Battery drain down in half and hour when internet is on.
<<&&&&>>
When I received my phone was very happy until now after couple use I see the battery life is very bad don’t hold chages very long I have to keep charging not good at all
<<&&&&>>
bought it for my daughter who is loving it.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone at the beginning g of October. It completely died on January 13 and has not been able to turn on. I don’t know what happened.
<<&&&&>>
Works great, I would recommend the seller.
<<&&&&>>
Please do not waste your time or money ordering this phone. It does not work. The phone had minor scratches but it could not be added to a company using a SIM card. Spare yourself the trouble.
<<&&&&>>
excelente producto
<<&&&&>>
My daughter purchased this phone and so far so good. Haven’t encountered any problems. Would buy it again
<<&&&&>>
My husband and I purchased two of these iPhones es and they work, but the batteries are both bad!! They drain when unplugged within about 1 hour!
<<&&&&>>
battery came at below 80% .. would go from 100% to 0% in less than 1hr, tried to contact seller and have been ignored. horrible customer service and miss advertised product
<<&&&&>>
Gradens
<<&&&&>>
Everything is ok
<<&&&&>>
Will buy again
<<&&&&>>
I have very little to complain about. With it being refurbished, I had low expectations. The phone came earlier than expected. It works perfectly and there is no glitches with the phone. For less than 200, the phone was quite the bargain.
<<&&&&>>
I have a government issued phone line. Only way to upgrade is buying your own unlocked phone. Works perfectly!!
<<&&&&>>
one moth later this iphone 6s is working as it should. it sucks that we have become so dependent on these damn things!!!!
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this phone and it arrived in about a week. It was overheating and drained battery. I returned it and got another one. Shipping was great. The second one is working perfectly fine. Overall, a good purchase.
<<&&&&>>
muy bueno 😍
<<&&&&>>
The gift was My daughter fell in love with it
<<&&&&>>
Came Like New, No Scratches Nothing. Great Buy, Monies Worth
<<&&&&>>
Great phone, the battery just sucked a*s
<<&&&&>>
Works great this is the second one I bought
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy! Will contact Amex on this. Bout the phone for my mother in Brazil and the SIM card reader is broken. She is now spending over $180 repairing
<<&&&&>>
None of the apps work on the phone. Was dirty and barely functions. All requests for refunds go unanswered. I got this as a present for my daughter and it cant even open basic apps.
<<&&&&>>
People we called said they had a hard tome hearing and the volume went up and down. Had the phone diagnosed by Apple store and they said the microphone was bad. Will be sending this phone back.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was broken with a dis functional charging port
<<&&&&>>
I bought it for my daughter, it’s great. I hope y’all still have good quality phones because I gotta get my son one in November.
<<&&&&>>
Me gusto mucho es un iPhone 📱 muy bueno 😍❤️ De buena calidad 👌👍
<<&&&&>>
Phone is in great shape and works wonderfully. The battery wasn’t in the best condition but that was an easy fix. I scheduled an appointment at the Apple Store and they replaced it for $29. They will do this through December 31, 2018.
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies fast, screen gets stuck, I’ve seen the phone do weird stuff and my friend say “ send it back” I just don’t have time to deal with it. It is what it is.
<<&&&&>>
There are some software bugs. Besides that it’s a pretty good, if you need a one right now. The pictures quality and battery life is lower than I expected! Even with those issues i think it was worth the compromise.
<<&&&&>>
Had it 3 weeks and it stopped working. After a week of leaving the screen on 24/7 because it would no longer turn on if I locked it I finally had enough and three it against a wall.
<<&&&&>>
I was disappointed to have to return this phone. I did everything, and I mean everything, to up the volume but still had to put all calls on speaker in order to hear them.
<<&&&&>>
This is exactly what it’s supposed to be I LOVE IT
<<&&&&>>
Excellent really. It works perfect with all carriers in Venezuela.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent purchase! I am so happy with my phone! Such a savings! It is like brand new!
<<&&&&>>
Battery came in not wanting to charge, replaced the charge port (had one from parts phone) began charging only has 70% battery capacity... JUNK
<<&&&&>>
This product came in good condition fully unlocked and was easy to use. Also included was a compatible charger and free 3 month SIM card from Mint mobile
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks like new, though the battery discharges a little quicker than I expected. It didn't come with earphones, but overall I'm happy with buy.
<<&&&&>>
Buen servicio
<<&&&&>>
False advertising it wasn’t unlocked to any carrier
<<&&&&>>
The battery is a bit weak but overall I'm happy with this phone. After all, you get whay you pay for.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my mother and I could not be happier. Phone looks and works as new. Fast shipping and great customer service
<<&&&&>>
❤️
<<&&&&>>
Llego en perfecto estado esta como nuevo lo unico malo el cargador solo duro una semana y ya el iphono no lo reconoce osea no sirve... recomendaria el telefono pero el cargador no sirve
<<&&&&>>
Good condition
<<&&&&>>
Works great.
<<&&&&>>
Over all great phone. Works really good. Gets the job done. Only problem is small scratch on the screen but you can’t tell. Battery life is ok.
<<&&&&>>
The Phone is stuck on the apple logo. Been like that for 3 days.Tried connecting to Itunes and doing a restore. Still nothing. returning it.
<<&&&&>>
The product was better than I expected. Had it for about a month now and there are no problems except that the camera shutter doesn’t turn off which is a bit annoying. The phone had no scratches or dents and looked perfectly new
<<&&&&>>
Had to return the phone. Didn't work
<<&&&&>>
Using it right now. It's perfect
<<&&&&>>
Product came as described.. looks and works like new.. I got my iPhone 6s with Buyspy I would recommend this company
<<&&&&>>
I was very disappointed that the silence button on the side of the phone didn’t work. Especially since the phone was said to have gone through a Thorough inspection. I would not recommend this seller to friends or family.
<<&&&&>>
Very nice phone...looks new
<<&&&&>>
I got this product in the mail literally 10 minutes ago and im livid. The entire screen is scratched and the sides are banged up. I get that is refurbished but geez.
<<&&&&>>
Hit or miss
<<&&&&>>
Buy but be warned the battery would come dead or almost dead. Asides that , it was a very clean phone to buy
<<&&&&>>
Battery life came at 88%. It looked new and it had no scratches on it. Would definitely recommend buying from this seller

It was okay for like 2 weeks after which it started glitching. The battery doesn’t stay charged for long and it sometimes shuts down unexpectedly
<<&&&&>>
It did look new but the battery drain very fast I will be sending it back also the internet load slow
<<&&&&>>
My daughter loves her new iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Really good, battery lasted long.. As I reside in Jamaica, it worked perfectly with my SIM card. Battery charged pretty fast as well.. And it looks brand new, no scratches.
<<&&&&>>
Went to have phone turned on and found out it was reported stolen. Now we have to return it & get our money back
<<&&&&>>
The phone works fine, although the battery runs out fast and you have to charge it a lot .I like the phone but wish the battery didn't suck.
<<&&&&>>
It's working fine. I bought it for the specific purpose of flying a drone so I haven't exactly put it through much.
<<&&&&>>
Received my phone earlier than expected which was great! I have cricket service so it was easy to switch over phones! Phone is in great condition no scratches screen is clear! So far so good! I would recommend this seller!

<<&&&&>>
As described, good
<<&&&&>>
The phone is amazing other than it didn’t come with 16GB mine came with only 5GB
<<&&&&>>
Hello, I just bought this phone about a week ago, and it was perfect, working and all, and now it wont cut on, I was using the charger you sent with the phone, and it fried my device. I would like another one sent to me for free. I still have the box and the packaging it came from. I love the phone, but I would like to get another one, without the charger frying my device.
<<&&&&>>
Kids love them
<<&&&&>>
This phone arrived earlier than expected and is in near perfect condition. Only slight nick on side. Battery holds charge. No issues
<<&&&&>>
Got it for metro pcs in California worked good couple scuffs but works fine and comes w charger
<<&&&&>>
It came in a brand new product. My girlfriend really liked it.
<<&&&&>>

I still use the phone to this day still in perfect condition
<<&&&&>>
xxx
<<&&&&>>
Excellent value.
<<&&&&>>
Very fast phone and looks brand new. Downside is that the battery life time is very low. Unfortunately I’m constantly on the move and need battery life.
<<&&&&>>
Phone screen cracked and phone had lots of scratches
<<&&&&>>
You get what you pay for , I didn’t start noticing the glitches and how the screen freezes until after a month and now I can’t return it 😔

<<&&&&>>
It is a really good phone. I upgraded from a ZTE and I am loving it. It is good for the price.
<<&&&&>>
The battery life sucked right out of the box. With a 5 min video call the battery drained from 95% to 40%.
<<&&&&>>
Nice
<<&&&&>>
Doesn’t work
<<&&&&>>
Todo bien

<<&&&&>>
It stopped working with no clear signs as to why
<<&&&&>>
Great phone beat quality worth the money
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
The product won’t charge
<<&&&&>>
Only had to replace the battery
<<&&&&>>
AWESOME PHONE. WORKS PERFECTLY
<<&&&&>>
The phone is fine, except the battery was not replaced. The seller gave me a 10% discount but not a new battery!
<<&&&&>>
EXCELLENT phone came looking brand new! Had no troubles at all I recommend buying it! Excellent deal was very great! Came with phone and charger
<<&&&&>>
I love this phone!! It’s quick and works perfectly for me. I’m so happy with it
<<&&&&>>
Probably have to buy a new battery, so not a great deal
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono vino bloqueado
<<&&&&>>
Good condition! it looks and work pretty well!
<<&&&&>>
The product is excellent it’s Exactly how it is in the descriptions
<<&&&&>>
The iphone would not work with my local carrier.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t like the fact that the phone didn’t come with earphones.
<<&&&&>>
Overall good product
<<&&&&>>
Great! Better than I expected!
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone!
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
This is a great product. The phone is as good as new and well packaged. Great job mywit. I'll gladly recommend this vendor any day anytime!
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
I love it.
<<&&&&>>
No marks, excellent product
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
was very pleased with purchase and seller
<<&&&&>>
The phone is in good condition. Looks and feels new, works with US and international sims, however, the battery lasts between 3-4hrs. With brightness at minimum, WiFi off and without sharing location. OUCH! Asked the buyer about battery life and NEVER recieved a reply
<<&&&&>>
Just received my package in the mail. Ordered it on the 4th of this month got it today two days later. So far so good. Phone is in beyond amazing condition all speakers, buttons, touch screen and other functions working properly as well. I hope this continues to be a purchase well worth it down the line.
<<&&&&>>
This phone was supposed to be fully unlocked. However, as it’s shown in the picture, it’s a Verizon model
<<&&&&>>
The phone came 2 days ahead of schedule! It looks amazing; better than "good". Popped in the Walmart Family Mobile SIM card and in 2 minutes it was live on the network. No messing around. This one was for my wife. I will be buying one for myself next month from this seller.
<<&&&&>>
I'm always sceptical to buy such big things online but I took the chance and this phone has been nothing but great so far. It works well and it comes in a nice package where it's protected. I recommend. 10/10!
<<&&&&>>
Recibí este teléfono funcionó bien 5 días y luego empezó a tirar error en la batería hasta que dejó de cargar . Ahora tengo que llevarlo a servicio técnico porque no carga .
<<&&&&>>
Terrible quality. Has a cheap replacement screen. Speaker didn’t work and phone was to hot to even put up to your ear
<<&&&&>>
It’s ok
<<&&&&>>
Got the phone March 27 and started using it immediately. By March 31st, 4 days later, the phone was shutting down for 20 minutes at a time and restarting on its own agenda. I have to return this iPhone. t may be refurbished, but it doesn't work.
<<&&&&>>
Not happy but at least it’s cheap
<<&&&&>>
Although the phone I received was cosmetically perfect, it was not unlocked at all. The description said it was a fully unlocked phone and this one would only work on Verizon. The seller will not return emails and the phone number goes to voice mail. I ended up having to return it. I would not recommend buying from them.
<<&&&&>>
Couldn't get metro service so not unclocked to all
<<&&&&>>
I would definitely buy a product from this seller! I gave it to my cousin as birthday present and she was so happy with it! a little scratch on the sides but its not a big deal!
<<&&&&>>
I may need to send the phone back in because the battery life is really short and it seems to have some small glitches in it!
<<&&&&>>
I bought one on Black Friday and it looks and works perfectly! So far so good, I love it 👍🏽
<<&&&&>>
Me encantó el iPhone que me llegó este lunes esta igual que la imagen y me encanta demasiado!!👍👍
<<&&&&>>
As I'm sure a lot of you know, it's difficult to find a reasonably priced CDMA unlocked iPhone. I was looking for one to use with Straight Talk on their Verizon network, but most iPhone 6 or greater cost around 450. I was incredibly skeptical of this, but gave it a shot. It's only my first day, so I know things can always go wrong, but so far it's working well. Came with the phone and charging cable. The box it came in looked a little rough, but the phone was fine. I only noticed 2 very small cosmetic flaws and they don't bother me in the slightest. The screen is completely free of imperfection. Setting up the phone with Straight Talk was a little tricky, but that had nothing to do with the phone, in my opinion. In case anyone else is planning to the do the same, here's how it went for me. I did the BYOP activation kit and am using a new number - I did not port an existing number. I slipped in the "Verizon" sim that came with the kit and tried to activate it online. It told me the phone wasn't compatible and I was disappointed. I called customer service and we were able to get it up and running, despite the representative also being unsure that it would work. I did have to update to the latest software before really using the phone. That was the most time-consuming part. Can't complain yet, especially for the price! I know it isn't "new" but the difference can hardly be seen.
<<&&&&>>
Phone seems to work fine EXCEPT it needs a NEW BATTERY. Amazon help line connected me EVENTUALLY to Apple. Apple said the hardware is not warranted. Battery costs $29. Not exactly sure what the certified refurbished means. So save a couple hundred on the phone and plan on buying a new battery. Internet is awash with iPhone battery issues.
<<&&&&>>
Ordered this phone through Electronic Deals. Took it to Verizon for a sim card and found out the sim card tray was bent. The technician was able to get the sim card in, but with some difficulty. The battery in this phone is useless. It only stays charged for about an hour. Electronic Deals sent us a new sim card tray and said they would reimburse us up to $20 toward a new battery. It is a major inconvenience to try and find an Apple Store where we can go get this taken care of. They aren't exactly located all over - the closest one to us is an hour and a half drive away. Ordering one of these phone is taking a chance and hoping that maybe the one you order will be decent - but very likely not. I think Amazon should require that these phones be in better condition before being sold. The response I got back from Electronic Deals was that I could return the phone if I'm not happy, but that isn't the easiest thing to do once you have activated it with your carrier and then don't have another phone to use in the meantime. I am very dissatisfied.
<<&&&&>>
Very fast shipping got it next day. I opened it up and was packaged very well and looked bran new, no scratches or marks anywhere. Very easy to set up and I used .99 cent tracfone SIM card from amazon. Buy the bring your own card has three different sizes, do not be concerned about the three different carriers with the different size cards just use the one that has the micro card. Once installed in the phone go to tracfone site to activate by putting in the iPhone MIEI Number and SIM card number and you cell phone number it’s all self explanatory and easy, it transferred my minutes etc from old phone to new phone, very easy, I did not have to call customer service. Phone is great and glad I bought it.

Family member’s iPhone 6s was having some trouble (inconsistently) with it recognizing an invisible headphone that wasn’t inserted in its earphone jack. This could explain why Apple removed the jack in next model. Apple also wanted to charge me over $300 for a new one at the Apple store, but I let them know I wasn’t falling for that bullsh|t of in-store price. So far so good with the refurbished unlocked iPhone (original one that was having issues mentioned above was not an unlocked model), but was sent with very minimal. Included in package was an off-brand (“Outside the Box” or something like that) charger and iPhone 6s with 93% battery health. By no means is using Amazon Renewed like picking up products from Apple or carrier store (when/if still available), but it gets those who’s phone died a replacement quickly. Definitely recommend if one were an iPhone user that didn’t want to switch out SIM for international trip nor pay international fees of American carriers.
<<&&&&>>
The cellphone was connected to another number. Very bad. It does not work and I am trying to return it.
<<&&&&>>
This item is in mint condition. NOT ONE SCRATCH, NOT ONE BLEMISH. I took it to the Apple store and compared it to a new 6S and saw a very slight difference in overall color. I am really happy with this seller and this item. Battery is also very good!
<<&&&&>>
I bought this new as a gift. Never heard of any problems with it or no request to return so I'm assuming it's performing as expected. Price was competitive and actually a bit better than walmart.com with prime shipping. I'm trying to be objective because I don't care for Apple products. No memory expansion is one big reason but also customer support. But it's a nice phone with ease of use high. And the installed or available to install software Garage Band is a nice digital music creator. So my issue with Apple notwithstanding it's a well made product at a competitive price that made the receiver happy so if Apple is your preference it's the deal for you.
<<&&&&>>
phone was not in the package, only a charger
<<&&&&>>
I have for years bought refurbished iPhones for my family on amazon I only had 1 issue with a phone over the years and I had no issue getting another phone. I bought 3 in the past few months all have worked fine and hold up and you brand new when they arrive just buy from top prime sellers look at seller star rating many go under same iPhone heading but double check who selling it under that heading. They are not all the same
<<&&&&>>
They look just like new and performed well. Nice packaging and great shipment time. I needed them to trade in for four iPhone 11's, but could not have been more satisfied with the product. To me, the phones all looked like replacement stock rather than used. Came with new, off-brand chargers and cables.
<<&&&&>>
Looks brand new. Battery life is at 83% according to the battery tester onboard the device. Screen was perfect, body was perfect, arrived with a Belkin charger cable and power adapter. So far so good.
<<&&&&>>
Bought the phone for my seven year old. Only flaw is the battery shuts the device off at 20%. Since it’s a refurbished device I wasn't able to use the battery test function. Fingerprint for security doesn’t work and the phone started shutting down randomly.
<<&&&&>>
I lost my 7s iPhone and replaced it with this phone. The battery life absolutely SUCKS! I can have 100%, talk 20 minutes and be down to 10%. I am very disappointed with this vendor and Amazon. I did not expect the performance of a brand new phone but I did expect decent battery life! I have turned into one of those people who is constantly looking for an outlet to plug in my phone charger. I have to keep a charger with me at all times. It is almost like I don’t have a phone because it is dead all the time.
<<&&&&>>
Very nervous about purchasing from online. My daughter in law gave me tips. Then I ordered. I am very pleased with the phone. No problem at all with one - had the background analyzed by by daughter in law and not a problem except they put in a new part and it was an Apple Part. I love the phone and am glad I did it.
<<&&&&>>
So far so good I purchased this refurbished iphone6s in August it pretty ok, work great I’m from Trinidad so I took a change didn’t regret, battery life good, sometimes it runs down pretty quickly but that’s because I’m always on my phone, no magior problem, a little scratch on the screen other than that it came in good condition.....
<<&&&&>>
It turns on, but now has an error message “cannot connect to internet” It can’t be used as a phone anymore, it can be used to browse for solutions to the problem, so it’s still doing something. Not sure what’s going on. It indicates “no service”. Dropped the SIM into another phone and that phone worked perfectly. Suspect there a hardware issue inside the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Battery would not hold a charge for longer than 20minutes. Ended up trading it for a new phone. Fortunately they accepted the device. Two stars only because I was able to trade it in and get my value out of the phone. Save yourself the grief and just get a new iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
I assumed that my order would come like around the 12th but I am happy to say I got them way before the delivery date today. Plus the phones look brand new. Will be ordering again.
<<&&&&>>
Never had a problem with this seller bu=ought an iphone 6s and came in like it was brand new. be careful with who you buy your phone from. but if you want an iphone 6s buy from this sell.
<<&&&&>>
Just switched to an iphone and this is fine. Holds a decent charge, good photos and I can now facetime!! No problems with delivery either. I guess smartphones are a necessary evil.
<<&&&&>>
Love this device love the seller Phone completely wiped clean Wow Feels good to use what’s here as far as apple goes Big thumbs up Thank you
<<&&&&>>
No issues with this iPhone. It has no scrapes or scratches. Battery was around 80%. Would purchase again.
<<&&&&>>
We doubt about refurbished product, but i feel this was a good choice, the item come with not original accesories, but come totally functional, with front and rear of 100%, quality, thanks good item
<<&&&&>>
I always wanted an iPhone and got a great dal from Amazon. I also got a book on how to use iPhone 6s. I am very pleased with this iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
I enjoy, my phone won’t do what other 6s do. Suppose because it’s used, now I know why.
<<&&&&>>
The phone did not have any scratches. It was easy to program and works great so far. I bought it for my daughter.
<<&&&&>>
I like a big phone to see the information
<<&&&&>>
I like the quality of this phone. I’ve had for 4 days now. And my only complaint is the battery life. But once I replace the battery it should be fine. But for a $200 phone it’s not bad. Other than that the phone works great.
<<&&&&>>
bought this for my grandson. he seems perfectly happy with it, haven't heard any complaints about it yet
<<&&&&>>
Item works fine however we were a bit disappointed in the physical condition. Not the cleanest. Pretty scratched up.
<<&&&&>>
Great product and in great condition for being refurbished . No complaints
<<&&&&>>
Great buy. Bought in March 2019. It still works great
<<&&&&>>
I love my new I Phone.
<<&&&&>>
We got it for audio books from library and working well. Very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
I just got this for simple online stuff, not a heavy user
<<&&&&>>
Good quality
<<&&&&>>
There were scratches on the screen
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies in 1 hour of use.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect! I love it 😍😍😍
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone 6s was as described. No problems so far. Next purchase will have more storage but for now it suits my needs.
<<&&&&>>
So happy to receive this. Easy to add to my AT&T acct.
<<&&&&>>
So far all good
<<&&&&>>
Had it for 4 months. Everything good.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was a gift but I got to set it up. Looks great. It came in good shape and seems to work smoothly
<<&&&&>>
Great price for phone works like new
<<&&&&>>
Everything you would expect with an iPhone, very pleased with my purchase
<<&&&&>>
Like you see these are not minor scratches and for money i paid i expected better condition.
<<&&&&>>
Love it!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
GREAT THANKS
<<&&&&>>
This phone arrived in brand new condition. I had it activated a week ago, and so far, no issues.
<<&&&&>>
Speakers are really messed up. Other than that a few scratches
<<&&&&>>
Very satisfied
<<&&&&>>
Satisfecha con la compra , mi Mamá está feliz con su regalo 😊 Hasta el momento no ha presentado alguna falla
<<&&&&>>
Got this phone for my daughter. She loves it!
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition. Works great. Not a mark on it.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone
<<&&&&>>
It was in great condition! Arrived timely. It is working great so far! Fully unlocked as stated.
<<&&&&>>
Too much for no space
<<&&&&>>
It worked! Like new condition.
<<&&&&>>
I've had the phone for a couple weeks now and it works great!
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone in which it seemed to be in perfect condition, couple of days of use and it’s already not working!! For example, my phone will be on 80% and it will all of a sudden turn off and I won’t be able to turn it back on for 20mins to sometimes 2 hours at a time. I do use this as a business phone so it’s dire that I can rely on it to stay on like I need it to. I’ve already done a hard reset on it and tried restoring it through iTunes and the same issue is still occurring. I need to return this. This is ridiculous.
<<&&&&>>
I got my phone just in time! : ) Its just like the picture as it was described. Thank you!
<<&&&&>>
My phone was cosmetically excellent, only a tiny scratch on the screen in a couple of places. It was fully unlocked - tested on AT&T and Verizon (Verizon is where it was ultimately connected). Battery life seems pretty good so far (using for about a week but I am not on it constantly like some people). Battery health (Beta) on the phone in settings says it's 88% max capacity (although it does charge to 100%). I ordered 16GB but you forget that the operating system takes up almost all of the available space which stinks (apple needs to fix that). Gave it 4 stars because it did not come with an apple charger/cord and it took longer to charge with the crappy ones they sent compared to when I connected it to a real apple charger that I have for my work phone. I also appreciate the sellers putting instructions on how to contact them if there are any issues. I hope that I am still happy with the phone in a month but no complaints thus far.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone for a great price! Works great also. The phone had a couple scuffs on it but it is refurbished so that was expected. I use a case though and you cannot see the scuffs; everyone thought I had gotten a brand new phone just by a taking a quick glance at it. I don't think I will ever waste money to buy a brand new phone again when you can get refurbished ones that work great! I have Verizon and they gave me a new SIM card for free and got my phone going within minutes. I had no issues. Would buy again.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in good shape and all the features worked my only complaint is the 16GB version is too small to hold any photos or videos, there is only room for the operating system and nothing else
<<&&&&>>
Great product!!
<<&&&&>>
Motherboard died after 6 weeks. Unrepairable.
<<&&&&>>
The phone I got from this place is a piece of junk..didn't work at all and this seller is not nice
<<&&&&>>
Received in good condition, couple of scratches on the glass, but noticed display acting weird once activated. By second day, screen went black and started flashing back and forth between black screen and white screen with apple logo. Tried restart and restore with iTunes, but it didn't work. Flashed back and forth until the battery died. Didn't deal with the seller, since it was a lemon. Just returned it through Amazon. Won't buy refurbished iphone again. Received seller feedback to this review on 8/9, telling me that Apple claims, ""Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015." They want me to delete this review. Hello! You refurbished/ sold this iPhone. You should have caught the problem before selling it.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone because my phone broke. It is an expensive price and I didn't know if it would come good because it is refurbished. I opened it and I was stunned. I ordered rose gold, and it was perfect! You couldn't even tell that it was refurbished and the rose gold was shiny and perfect and absolutely no scratches or dents, you can't even spot a tiny blemish! It was beautiful, they got everything right. I have never written a review before but had to right so I could totally prove that this phone comes in perfect condition and you can trust this seller. I am so happy with my phone, it works perfectly, nothing is broken. It came with a plastic seal too! The box was extremely dented but did not damage the phone in any way. It didn't come with headphones, it came with a charger, that was black(not apple charger) which was very good. Nevertheless, even if I didn't get my headphones I still am in love with this iPhone. I recommend!!
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Overall I am very impressed with the two refurbished iPhones we got. The "battery health" were both at 85%, which get me through the entire day before needing to recharge. I would absolutely suggest getting this phone instead of getting the top of the line phone (unless you can afford 1 grand for a new phone, then more power to you).
<<&&&&>>
DO NOT BUY!!! Not unlocked. I had to pay to get it imei unlocked, only to find out they did a software unlock because neither phones had a clean imei!!! Phones were dead within a week this place is a scam!!!!
<<&&&&>>
BE WARNED. Certified Refurbished means whatever they want it to mean. This product may say certified refurbished, but do not confuse that with an Apple certified refurbished product. 4 months after getting this iPhone the charging port started malfunctioning. 2 weeks later it would not charge at all. We took it to the apple store where we learned we were basically screwed. A Certified Apple Refurbish would have been under warranty. But if you buy a phone here, you have 60 days for the problems to show up or you will be screwed too. Certified, but by who? Guaranteed? Not really. In speaking to Apple, they are NOT condoning sales of these types, they do NOT support outside party certifications, and rightfully so, as this is how you ruin a reputation. Putting terrible product out on the market that no one can do anything about. You are far better off dealing with apple and making sure your investment is covered with a guarantee that means something. We are out a lot of money for a phone that lasted roughly 15 weeks. Now I'm frustrated with Amazon too.
<<&&&&>>
So far, so good. Phone was well packaged, looks like new and operates flawlessly! If you don’t hear back from me, you’ll know that I am as happy as can be with my new phone!
<<&&&&>>
**UPDATE March 3rd, 2019** So the phone itself works very well I’ve had only minor issues with it and that’s what I am writings of it about. The touch ID sometimes is not responsive and sometimes I have a hard time actually engaging the dictation button. I’ll tap directly on it and it won’t register me touching it but it will register the emoji key and the space key right next to it. I’ve also run into issues with the battery. The phone will randomly shut itself off around say 10%. It doesn’t do it every time, it’s completely at random. When I try to power it back on and it will show the empty battery with the power plug and red bar at the end of the battery saying that the battery is dead. However, when I go to plug my phone back into a charger and power it up, it will say that it is actually at say 40%. I can’t say I’m too thrilled about spending $80 to have the battery replaced. Amazing phone for a great price! It arrived quickly and has no blemishes on it whatsoever. When it did come in, it was dead so I had to plug it in but within 5 minutes or so, it was up to 4% and I was able to power it on. I was moving from Android back to iPhone and try to use the Move to IOS app but it didn't work out too well. I doubt that is an issue with the phone though. The battery lasts several hours with heavy use and when it gets low, it charges back up very quickly. The network I use is Straight Talk which uses Verizon's towers and I was able to get it set up very quickly. It does not come with a SIM card so you will have to buy one for your provider. However, it does come with a SIM card tool which is like a little pin to eject the SIM card slot. If for some reason it doesn't come with the tool, you can easily use a push pin just keep in mind the SIM card slot comes out all the way. It does have a sticker on the back with the serial number and the IMEI number which doesn't come off cleanly. I used Goo Gone to remove the residue and it cleaned it up nicely. You can see that in the pictures.

I was not sure to buy a phone online it was actually from sister, but she loves it until now like a month since I bough it Is working great , u can tell that is not new but it looks like new , I would say u should If you’re seeing this review... btw I got it from “buy seller “ .
<<&&&&>>
I read so many reviews and it seemed many people were thrilled while many others were very unhappy. The Amazon renewed guarantee is confusing because if the third-party only has a 30 day return policy. That’s all you get not 90 days. I got mine at Blutek Intl and we are thrilled. Cosmetically like new with 100% battery. I also received an email from Amazon saying it was an Amazon refreshed phone and I had a full 90 warranty. Also, I did not buy the cheapest phone at $167, I went down the list and found it a seller with very high ratings and $185 price tag; well worth the extra $18. If you are not sure if the seller gives the full 90 days, I would recommend calling Amazon; they call you back in 30 seconds! Make sure you understand what you are buying BEFORE you buy it. I also wish people would mention what Seller they bought from, good or bad. Rants with no Seller names are not very helpful.

I bought this phone as an upgrade to my old iPhone. I do like the larger screen and the better camera, however there are some major problems that overshadow that and make me wish I went with a droid. My battery came to me at 70%. That’s pretty low. The first few days with my phone I was shocked that the battery life was even worse than my 5s by a long shot. I spend part of my day thinking about where I’m going to charge my phone next. I went to a concert with 90% battery and mid concert after 2 photos I noticed my phone was at 11%. Figured I’d turn it off to use for emergencies and a taxi later. Nope. My phone decharged itself entirely and refused to turn back on. Yesterday evening my phone also decharged itself while I slept on the charger. Good thing I didn’t have to be up early yesterday. These are basic things to owning a phone and apple can’t seem to get it straight. After this phone fully dies I’m heading to amazon. PS had to spend money on a new battery 2 months after I bought the phone.
<<&&&&>>
FYI it is model #A1688, I don't know why they can't just say that anywhere. It’s also the Japanese version which means you can’t disable the shutter sound (it’s a law there). So the phone looked great and was exactly what I ordered. But it’s the Japanese version with a loud shutter, so I’ll probablt return it if I can find a way to disable that (research online says it’s impossivld to disable it).
<<&&&&>>
So I personally was a little hesitant to buy this because I seen some many mixed reviews, but I decided to give it a chance because my old phone was too expensive to fix and I need a paid off phone ASAP. Anyway I got my package two days earlier and the phone looked brand new. There’s no scratches or dents. The phone is completely unlocked and is compatible with Verizon. The battery life is good and can hold a charge but only thing though is when you take pictures even on silent mode it does make the sound. This model is the a1688.
<<&&&&>>
Once it came it was packed and safe so the screen won’t crack. Also the phone looks great in fact I’m using the phone right now and from what I see is that the top right and bottom right corner have little dots (not deep) on it but that’s fine! And the battery heath was 92% I expected to be 100% because it says renewed but I appreciate it either way, but the battery can last me almost the whole day which is plenty enough time to use for school. The screen and the phone is outstanding and working perfectly I put a full protective screen on it just in case if I dropped it, the original screen is soft and smooth with no scratches and I would recommend you buying this because it’s an affordable price and has a lot of GB. The Phone came from CTS and they have more good reviews than most company’s I see so buy this one here!
<<&&&&>>
The first phone I received didn’t connect to The network. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a return label and assured me they would send a replacement and ensure that it connected to That network. Sure enough I got the replacement within a few days of them getting my returned phone and it works great. Phone looks like new and works as expected. It’s only been a couple days but as of right now, 5 stars. Excellent customer service
<<&&&&>>
Battery was terrible, had to buy a replacement battery and do the install to fix it. After the fix the phone is great. Bought 2 batteries because I bought the same phone on Ebay (for my other daughter) for 75.00 cheaper to see if I would have the same issue, same 9.5 rating and so far the battery is lasting just as long as the replacement battery I put in the first. Other then that the phone is great, but be prepared to buy another battery, but do some comparison shopping, same phone cheaper elsewhere, I thought buying on Amazon vs eBay was a better choice, I was wrong., could have saved 100$.
<<&&&&>>
I wish I could give zero stars because the phone is so messed up, it’s unusable. Phone screen won’t let me text, and when trying to open an app, without even touching the screen, it starts opening all these different apps. Reached out to seller to fix the issue and resolve but still have yet to hear back and it’s been two weeks
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself is great, but the battery could not hold a charge for more than ~3 hours (I fully charged it twice). I took it to Best Buy and they ran diagnostics and looked inside and said the phone was fine. The Best Buy technician said the battery was at 82% and didn't warrant replacement, but I had them replace it anyway for $50 as the phone would be useless to me if it couldn't hold a charge. The new battery solved the problem. I used the phone all day today and after 24 hours the charge has dropped from 100% to 50%. I would have rather paid the seller $50 more and saved myself an afternoon of running back and forth to Best Buy.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this phone because my 5s was getting painfully slow and the battery was not holding a charge properly anymore. It arrived exactly when it said it would. Rose Gold has always been my dream color phone and it was flawless! There are no dents in the metal and no scratches on the screen. It was updated to iOS 12 already, which I was worried it wouldn't be and I would have to do that myself. It came with a USB cord and a really nice wall charger which was a nice touch for a third party seller. I have heard good reviews about BuySPRY and they all come up to expectations. I think the screen protector I put on made the touch screen less sensitive but not by much -- it's worth the pain for an uncracked screen. Set up was fast and easy and if you have a SIM card, you can just pop it into your new phone and data plan and cell plan is instantly transferred over. I was worried about doing business with a third party seller, particularly about how the phone quality would be, but so far so good! I'll let you know how it's going in a couple of weeks! I would definitely recommend getting this phone!
<<&&&&>>
★ from Kim C. on January 22, 2019 No battery life As soon as i opened the box and pluged in the phone, not only was there residue in the charging port but the phone immediately became hot. After this when i would take it off the charger the battery would go down 4% at a time while doing nothing and within 10 minutes about 50% of battery life is lost. Not happy and am going to try to get a replacement and see if that works. Not happy with how this is going so far as these are supposed to be tested prior to shipment... the phone was also damaged upon delivery
<<&&&&>>
I really like the ability to use Marco Polo and easy text. I've started to use Siri which is super. This is the first smart phone I've ever had and it's been fairly easy to use. I've had a Mac Pro for years so the iPhone 6s uses the same basic icons and technique as the Mac Pro with just a few adjustments. I have a lot to learn but I'm getting there. No problems so far with this refurbished phone. I've had it for almost 4 weeks.
<<&&&&>>
arrived on time and was in prefect shape (couldn't see any scratches or dents) took it on my vacation and worked perfectly with the sim cards i bought in Hong Kong, Philippines & Japan Very satisfied
<<&&&&>>
After reading a lot of the reviews, which I took careful consideration in selecting the vendor, I was expecting a better conditioned phone. There was a lot of scrapes and dents along the edge of the phone; the previous owner clearly didn't use a case. All of the ports; headphone jack, charger, sim card, silent button, they all had a large build up of dirt in them. I had to carefully use a paper clip and some brushes to clean out all of the grime.. which I wasn't expecting, based on all of the positive reviews. The cleaning certainly lacked any attention to detail and the even the protective film was thrown on quite quickly, it overlapped at the edges and there was air bubbles all over. It would only take a few extra minutes to carefully clean the phone and apply the protective film correctly.
<<&&&&>>
The phone chargers fast but it also goes dead fast. The battery doesn’t last long . The charger that came with it has a shortage in it . Overall not worth it he money I paid but my niece likes the phone so it’s ok.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in great condition! Screen has plastic peely and package includes iPhone box and a charger that is not OEM but is compatible! The phone's battery life is pretty bad but I believe that is inherent to the model, not because it is refurbished. I had a lot of trouble setting this up with my carrier (T-Mobile) but after chatting with them then finally getting on a phone call with a technical specialist we were able to troubleshoot and modify some settings and it works fully now! If you do contact your carrier, let them know that it is an unlocked phone not designated to the specific carrier, so they can address your issues quicker! Would and have recommended this product to friends!
<<&&&&>>
Bought this phone as a replacement when my iPhone 8 Plus got stolen. The phone was delivered within 2 days. Looks brand new- no scratches, dents, etc. I was able to easily activate the phone with my existing Verizon phone number. Only downside, as other comments have said, is that the Snapchat camera does make the shutter sound and I can't find a way to turn it off. Other than that, I'm very pleased with my purchase and got exactly what I was expecting.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this iPhone as an Christmas present. Came in looking brand new even had plastic protector on the back. Really thought I scored big. No scratches or cracks. Turns out the phones IMEI is locked to Tracphone aka Straight talk, they were unable to unlock the phone due to their phones having to be on their network for a period of time. So three stars since she was unable to use thr phone. But excellent quality from this Amazon “Renew”
<<&&&&>>
Amazing price. Arrived just like new. I had to go to Verizon to get a SIM card, but then I don't even know what a SIM card is. The Verizon guy had it up and running in about 15 minutes. It replaces my old flip-phone and I learned there is no easy way to transfer data. Only disappointment was the charger cord is not apple and the cord has to be wiggled into place to get it to charge. After checking Apple price vs others I would have supplied the cheaper cord too. Would recommend this company.
<<&&&&>>
I have had to charge this phone as many as three times in one day! it discharges at an alarming rate. And although it takes a charge very quickly, it is unacceptable to go to 60% to 4% in 35 minutes. I will never buy an Apple phone again. Motorola and Samsung phones have much better battery life, and lets face it, you can put all kinds of features on a phone, but when the battery dies or goes into low power mode, what good are they?
<<&&&&>>
Yesterday I complained about a telephone not being able to be activated in T-Mobile. It turns out that the problem was the SIM card provided by them (T-Mobile) as when I installed it in my old pone it did not work either. After some consultation with -Mobile they changed the SIM card and the telephone worked beautifully. Is a good telephone and looks and feels just as new. I apologize for the negative review and this is to set the record straight so the seller is not affected by my former (negative) evaluation.
<<&&&&>>
Battery could use improvement, but that is the manufacturer not the seller. I was apprehensive about buying an unlocked iPhone in Amazon. But not a problem so far, love love love it. Performs as if it was bought from the apple store itself so I’m a happy customer
<<&&&&>>
Battery health 80% and it discharges completely overnight without use. Going to visit an apple store today to confirm and then return. I can't figure out why they aren't replacing the batteries when they refurb these. I also own a Note 9 and just had the screen replaced under insurance and during the repair they replaced the battery as standard procedure.
<<&&&&>>
I was nervous about purchasing as there were mixed reviews… I did have to replace the battery within a month of purchasing but I wonder if this is because of Apples updates that made the phones battery life shorter? Anyways, now that the battery is replaced it works great. Better route than buying a brand new phone for $800!
<<&&&&>>
Received this a day early and it looks like new. So far, so good. Set up was easy and was fully unlocked. Was able to get a SIM card from our phone company and everything worked just fine.
<<&&&&>>
Came in perfect working order all I did was put my SIM card in and it ran like it was supposed to got it a day early very pleased
<<&&&&>>
Bought same phone “used” at Best Buy for twice the price, it was in poor condition so I took a chance with this one instead! I couldn’t be happier and I’ve had it over a year now!
<<&&&&>>
i seen a lot of negative reviews and was skeptical of ordering this phone at first but i did anyways. i figured if i didn't like it then i could just return it. i got it and mine looks brand new! no scrapes, dents, smudges, nothing! the camera quality is perfect, everything is working the way it should! the battery is a little iffy but i mean... it's an iphone, they're known for their battery's not really living up to our expectations. overall i would say this was a really good purchase and i'm glad i splurged and bought it anyways:)
<<&&&&>>
Came from a country where it is illegal to turn off shutter sound, so every time I take a picture there is a loud obnoxious shutter sound which can not be avoided. Battery life is poor, some glitching
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived today as scheduled. Very prompt service. Included a 3rd party charger and cable as described. So far, so good! Looks great, just as described. I can't speak to the performance just yet but so far I'm impressed with the condition of the phone. It's definitely unlocked - I had no trouble inserting a SIM and connecting to my mobile provider. The battery is at 83%, so I will most likely get a new one in the next month or two under Apple's $29 battery replacement policy. Otherwise, looking good. I'll update this review as I use the phone day to day.
<<&&&&>>
If I didn't know this was a refurbished phone, I'd swear it was brand new! Looks and works perfectly. Charger and SIM tool included, which are huge bonuses. Plus it arrived two days early. Thank y'all!
<<&&&&>>
Phone came as described, in great shape! Only trouble I’ve had is with the home button freezing up a few times. Could have to do with storage space—not sure. Otherwise a fantastic phone!!
<<&&&&>>
I do not want a large phone nor do I use the phone for extensive video-watching or game playing. I make calls, send texts, read email and listen to audio books. And it is perfect for that without spending $1000
<<&&&&>>
At the time of writing this comment, it is the first day with the phone. Overall it’s not too bad, the battery life is pretty bad but I expected that from a refurbished iPhone. Everything else is fine, I did however find a few dent marks in the corners of the aluminum frame, mainly the lower left corner. But as I stated earlier, for what I paid for the phone it’s not too bad. I will definitely be taking it to a phone repair shop for a new battery some time though.
<<&&&&>>
Aren't refurbished phones supposed to have a replaced battery? The battery health of this phone was 60% when we received it! Tried it for a couple of weeks, but now it just shuts down randomly and intermittently. Bought from BuySpry. Be careful with this seller!
<<&&&&>>
I travel to Thailand extensively and always carry 2 phones. I can now carry just the Apple iPhone6S unlocked and swap between ATT & Thailand 123 Call Simm chips. Make traveling much easier.
<<&&&&>>
The phone appears fine with no scratches but dies quickly. It tends to restart itself or die around 30% battery. The audio is absolutely awful. It is extremely quiet and muffled. You need to put it on speakerphone while having a conversation in order to even begin to attempt hearing the person you are speaking to.
<<&&&&>>
From the first day that I received this phone, the ear piece had not worked at all. I cannot hear any phone calls unless I put the caller on speaker. Which is not always convenient. The battery on this phone was also only at 80% capacity when I received it. It has been a frustrating purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I’m happy with the way the phone looks but upon opening it, it shows it only has 88% battery lifespan. In order to be a certified refurb they REALLY should be replacing with a new battery. The price is expensive enough that the phone should work “as new” and that includes a battery that can hold a complete charge. Not pleased.
<<&&&&>>
I trusted the amazon 'renewed' label and bought this phone. The battery life is very very poor. It dropped from 100% to 50% in 5 minutes. Looks like the battery needs to be replaced soon. Do not trust the 'renewed' label. It is pretty misleading. I have written tot he seller and waiting for a response.
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone for the money! Works great. I bought it for my sister-in-law.
<<&&&&>>
We own several iPhones. We bought this for our 11 yr old. We are very happy with quality and performance. Housing looked as new.
<<&&&&>>
So glad to have a phone again but the battery is seriously awful. Will have to go purchase a new one. I’ve turned off and modified everything I can think of to keep it from draining as quickly. That’s the only drawback. I just watched it drop 4% typing this review.
<<&&&&>>
Crappy didn't work the phone was frozen didn't turn on screen went black don't buy refurbished
<<&&&&>>
Never owned a smart phone so this is exciting for me. I love the look and feel of it and the fact that it's compatible with TracFone is the frosting on the cake. It works beautifully, and is easy to operate. The customer service was there to answer questions for me before I even purchased the item.
<<&&&&>>
When i got the iPhone... was as the specifications... works wonderful the first week.... then i notice the battery did not last long as a new one... of course... if i want a new one quality... i get a full price retail... I just replace the battery and the phone works marvelous... I have no complains, camera works woo%, screen like was never touch, buttons impecable.... i cannot be more satisfy for my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Everything is excellent with this item, other than the earphone jack, it doesn't work properly for bigger headphones.
<<&&&&>>
Cosmetically, it was a good buy. But, it would not stay on (possibly battery issues?) so I returned it. I also had to pay return postage which was unexpected.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little hesitant but took a chance and glad I did. Perfect. Like new!
<<&&&&>>
Phone said it was locked multiple times after putting in my Sprint SIM card from my other phone. Stays good for about 10 min until the lock message appears. Did this process 3 times while also restarting my phone in hopes of it working. Big noticable scratch on phone.
<<&&&&>>
Purchased 2 of these and BOTH are 75% battery health and they specifically said in the description at least 80%. Very disappointing to have to immediately go now and buy a replacement battery. These were Christmas gifts for two young kids and the batteries are bunk.
<<&&&&>>
I like almost everything except it’s a little over priced after I bought it I found it for cheaper at other stores if you don’t mind the price then it’s great
<<&&&&>>
I ordered a rose gold iPhone 6s for my daughter’s birthday on the Fourth of July and I got the package today, 07/07/18, my daughter opened the package and we found out the phone was not included in the package only the charger (Photo included). My daughter was in tears when she opened this package and this doesn’t even deserve 1 star, but I’m giving it all the same in order to submit this review.
<<&&&&>>
Extremely disappointed. Came in defective. No volume on the earpiece. Something that is totally inexcusable!! No QC obviously. Made for a very disappointed birthday for my daughter!! No excuse for this. Never again.!! Refurbished means it should work as new!! Pathetic!!
<<&&&&>>
Works well and looks good too! Didn’t have any scratches! So far so good!
<<&&&&>>
The battery doesn’t last thinking of returning the phone
<<&&&&>>
Great one.. Only no hear phones
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my sister and she likes it.
<<&&&&>>
Came very badly scratched up (glass and back of phone) and dirty. Like sauce all over the back dirty. Works so far.
<<&&&&>>
Works well; very satisfied
<<&&&&>>
i just giv to my mother and is perfect no scratches o other imperfections the other owner they take good care of this iphone
<<&&&&>>
Phone has preformed good so far only had it 3 weeks
<<&&&&>>
My first smart phone. Great for the price, even though it’s an older version!
<<&&&&>>
Quality phone but battery life is not good
<<&&&&>>
Works well
<<&&&&>>
Everything was good but the sound would not turn off even on silent mode when taking pictures.
<<&&&&>>
I just popped my SIM card into this phone and that was it. The phone works perfectly, I had this exact same phone before I lost it, and the phone I had prior to this. I don’t see any flaws. Charges to 100% and has a good battery life. No damage to the phone whatsoever. Comes with a charging cube and cable. Noice
<<&&&&>>
Disappointed in the phone, when it arrived it didn’t turn on. I automatically thought it was a battery issue so I paid to have a new battery installed. After that it still didn’t turn on. Pretty much trash never again!! One star for fast shipping.
<<&&&&>>
excellent
<<&&&&>>
Just as described fast shipping
<<&&&&>>
Excellent price and quality! It was well packed and it came with no scratch! Work fine
<<&&&&>>
Phone came dirty, Battery last for 10 minutes even with brightness on low, camera shutter wont shut apps won't open it was waste of money i will never buy refurbished phone in my life
<<&&&&>>
This phone came completely dead, and after over 24 hours on the charger recommended by amazon tech service , it still did not turn on. They promised to call me to follow up, made an appointment, confirmed it, and they never called me back. Returned, and done with refurbished.
<<&&&&>>
Not I phone 6s
<<&&&&>>
came and had scratches on the back. went to go get it activated and it wouldnt work. I either need a refund or a new phone, im really disappointed with my purchase. Do not recommend
<<&&&&>>
This phone came to me without a single blemish or imperfection at all. It charges super fast and stays charged. Very easy to set up. Just went from a Samsung note to this 6S and I thoroughly enjoy it. Ten out of ten would buy again.
<<&&&&>>
I like this phone, price is fair , have no trouble when I m using . Will recommend it
<<&&&&>>
Overall the phone works well, but the battery is the problem. Only 75% of battery life remains there. Phone will shutdown automatically when the battery runs low. If I could know this problem, I won’t buy this one.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone itself is not the problem. It’s that I’m sure it said six plus before I ordered this and in the mail came the six.
<<&&&&>>
Estoy satisfecho con el producto
<<&&&&>>
This was like a brand new phone
<<&&&&>>
Works great, very happy with this. Like new.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone kinda worried about the bad reviews but it was great! looked like new. I got it set up and working. battery is not a problem. I had to charge it up because it came with half battery but its working really well. It doesn't come unlocked though. I had to go in and get it unlocked and get a sim card added but other than that no problem. I love it. works really well.
<<&&&&>>
I like the phone just wish it would have came with a better battery also the volume is really low even when turned all the way up.
<<&&&&>>
Always sort of concerned about buying used electronic products, but this has turned out to be a real winner - just as good as a new one!
<<&&&&>>
Seems to work well.
<<&&&&>>
The phone works and the price was great- the volume doesn’t work very well making it a difficult phone to use- Seriously, you do everything you want on the iPhone except make phone calls!😩
<<&&&&>>
Bought this phone when my old one stopped working. I have had it for 6 months and it works great.
<<&&&&>>
My first time getting a refurbished smartphone online, and I am so happy with the purchase! The phone came in almost like new, the surface has no flaw, although the battery life was a little bit on the down side, which was anticipated. Overall, amazing price for this iPhone, and I would definitely recommend!
<<&&&&>>
Just rcvd it today and screen is scuffed and a crack in it. Very diapointed in the quality of the product.
<<&&&&>>
If the battery wasnt very weak
<<&&&&>>
Tuve problemas al principio porque no lo pude configurar, lo lleve a un servicio técnico y solucione. Pido disculpas porque la solución inicial que encontré fue devolverlo.
<<&&&&>>
AMAZING price, AWESOME product, works GREAT, SUPER FAST shipping!
<<&&&&>>
great phone
<<&&&&>>
My wife finds this phone easy to use with good battery life
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in good condition and only had a few scratches around the charging port, which I was expecting from a refurbished phone. I was surprised that it came with a screen protector already on it, which was a plus. This is my first IPhone and I’m pleased so far!
<<&&&&>>
Volume doesn’t work and I feel very disappointed
<<&&&&>>
Fake phone All products are fake
<<&&&&>>
Perfect
<<&&&&>>
Touch screen did not work... took a while to get my refund back....
<<&&&&>>
exelente
<<&&&&>>
I love my phone. I think my only complaint is that the battery dies quickly. Other than that it works great!
<<&&&&>>
Perfecto
<<&&&&>>
The price was great and the phone worked like the new one it replaced
<<&&&&>>
I buy it 3 weeks ago and untill now works great. Perfect size and it looks like a new i phone for a good price :)
<<&&&&>>
My only complaint is there are scrapes and ding marks on the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone just little scratch on the side everything worked fine just the earpiece I think is very low so I alway make calls on loudspeaker
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks like it has been thrown down 5 flights of stairs!! The back and the corners are completely scratched up, and the back camera lens is cracked!! Very unsatisfied and disappointed!!
<<&&&&>>
Compre un celular Iphone 6 S , el sistema operativo no funciona , que trastesa mi primera compra a este proveedor y sale mas caro el arreglo que el costo del celular. Se queda blanco con la manzana en el medio.
<<&&&&>>
In the middle of text, the "Keyboard" switch to different characters (Dis-function). Sometime become too sensitive. Finger tips in the air "without touch the screen", the same character is type more than 3 times. Every time it happens, just press the power button. It will refreshed again.
<<&&&&>>
Ordered a iPhone it took longer than expected when I got the iPhone it worked two weeks and cut off and never would cut back on . When I took it to apple they said the whole system was blown
<<&&&&>>
Pos
<<&&&&>>
Great phone sometimes it take a little while for the camera to work but everything else is awesome!
<<&&&&>>
the battery is wack within 2 hours you have to charge but the phone is good overall
<<&&&&>>
It’s one of the older versions of the iPhone but this is one of he onl ones that I could get with m phone carrier. I would love the SE but this basically the same.
<<&&&&>>
I am deceived, never buy on online
<<&&&&>>
although they said very light scratches on the body but clean screen, it was WRONG! the screen had a black thick line across and black patches. unusable! I call it cheating. returned within 2 hours!
<<&&&&>>
Everything but the battery life was good. Battery capacity is at 74%. Battery dies fast. Full charge takes forever. Not satisfied with purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect
<<&&&&>>
Battery needs to be replaced already. Just got this phone about a month ago.
<<&&&&>>
It has a little dent in the corner but it’s not that noticeable. The battery dies really fast and the touch screen has a few problems
<<&&&&>>
Daughter likes it.
<<&&&&>>
I only have issues with the battery life...could’ve last a lil longer. It gives maybe 8-10 hours depending on what I’m using it to do. Nonetheless, it was worth my money.
<<&&&&>>
My battey life is 83 percent and cant be replaced by the company. The battery drains really really fast, i usually have to charge it within a couple hours.... and i cant pay the additional charge to get a 6s plus.
<<&&&&>>
We’ve purchase 2 in the last few weeks, both are working great and shipping was fast! A+
<<&&&&>>
This phone looked real purty.. and that’s it. It was glitching as soon as I turned it on and would die sporadically even with a full battery. I needed a phone for my new business and this has cost me time and money. Super disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
I really like it! There were no scratches; everything works perfectly. They had a screen protector already on the phone and they included a charger that works pretty well. Overall I’m completely satisfied with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Great value
<<&&&&>>
Can barely hear when talking on the phone . Also the bottom always supper scratched when it arrived
<<&&&&>>
This is my second one I've ordered from Kiss Electronics. My first one was stolen. I really like the 12 megapixel camera.
<<&&&&>>
There is a dent in the back of phone and scratch on one of the corners
<<&&&&>>
It's dead after 5 months
<<&&&&>>
Its good so far minimal signs of usage. Charger isn't working properly tho need a new one.
<<&&&&>>
this product was a gift ? bottom line don't work/ refurbished means it was newly fixed, (REFURBISHED MEANS WHATEVER WAS WRONG HAS BEEN FIXED, even though its second hand ( don't have photo )
<<&&&&>>
It was a gift for my sister. I didn't open the box 'til i gave it to my sister and she realised the battery life wasn't good at all. It just lasts 3 or 4 hours.
<<&&&&>>
It works and is in good condition! Definitely worth it.
<<&&&&>>
Phone in fantastic condition 3 months already..knock on wood
<<&&&&>>
It was a perfect purchase, nothing negative to mention about this transaction 😊
<<&&&&>>
A un mes de compra todo en orden parece nuevo
<<&&&&>>
I got the iPhone 6s 64gb. First of all i don't think its well refurbished. it might stop working in few weeks. ALSO the phone came with Fake looking charger. I want the original iPhone charger.
<<&&&&>>
Looks and operates like new, even though it's refurbished. Very attractive phone. It's a little small in size though.
<<&&&&>>
Thanks for your service, my daughter loves it very much and she said no problem at all.
<<&&&&>>
Worked well for several weeks but the touch screen freezes up occasionally.
<<&&&&>>
Ive been using this phone since Jan 2019 and I was truly impressed with the quality of phone. Phone was near brand new. Happy I got a good deal.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone for value of money, but bad battery life. Just gift for someone though.
<<&&&&>>
Screen flickers and drop down menu appears, but is stuck halfway, every time phone is unlocked.
<<&&&&>>
El estado del teléfono estaba bien ., solo la batería se gasta rápido
<<&&&&>>
My phone came in the mail today, it's in amazing condition, you would never know it it used/refurbished. I'm very happy with my order! I set it up with MetroPCS and everything is going good!
<<&&&&>>
Nothing
<<&&&&>>
I really like the bigger screen and long battery life.
<<&&&&>>
I didn't appreciate the fact that the phone came loose inside the box. It could have been packaged a little more safely. Other than that, it looks brand new and seems to be in working order so far. Hoping I don't have any issues out of it. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Works well as a birthday gift
<<&&&&>>
Recieved phone speaker crackle noise and would not except iTunes sent back still waiting on refund.
<<&&&&>>
it was a gift for my daughter. she loves it and its very much what she expected.
<<&&&&>>
The phone did have scratches and a dent on it and tends to overheat.
<<&&&&>>
I was hesitant to buy as I am from South Africa but I can not be more pleased! The battery is not new, but I was expecting that! Very pleased with my buy!
<<&&&&>>
Excellent product, and delivered on time. Thank you very much!
<<&&&&>>
So far so good! It basically looks like a brand new phone. It’s the specifications I asked for and most important It’s unlocked
<<&&&&>>
Better than I expected. I ordered a 6s and got a 6S+. It works great
<<&&&&>>
Good phone but does not work for metro pcs
<<&&&&>>
Poor poor poor.. Try send a voice note the message takes forever to start record Volume so low have to put on speaker to hear for both incoming and outgoing calls. Press screen sometimes it doesn't respond
<<&&&&>>
I change my mind bc when i saw the free sim card i was like wow i feel bad now.But it had a crack on my screen when i bought it
<<&&&&>>
Looks perfect to me
<<&&&&>>
Replace 5S....perfect for all my needs
<<&&&&>>
it has worked as advertised. it is a great phone for the value. The 6s has the lowest fail rate, easily would recommend this phone.
<<&&&&>>
Volume control did not work . Phone returned for refund to cc
<<&&&&>>
Defective product. Don’t buy these second hand products from unauthorized sellers. The product won’t recognize even common SIMS from ATT and T-mobile.
<<&&&&>>
Cosmetically flawless. Looks brand new. Battery life like new. Unlocked as described worked immediately that a SIM card was inserted.
<<&&&&>>
Despite this device is serviceable by apple anymore, it’s been great. The charge last so long.
<<&&&&>>
Phone nice ..fully unlocked.. Charger does not seems like the original doh
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with dents in the top corners. Battery life was at 64% of life and unexpected shutdowns due to degraded battery. Overall would still buy. I just swapped the battery for 29$ and the phone works great.
<<&&&&>>
Very happy so far... came with a screen protector on it.. probably a refurbished screen but
<<&&&&>>
This Iphone battery lasted less than 6 months! My battery dies after 1 hour I charged it. Moreover, the sound of the camera cannot be switched off because it is a Japanese or South Korean model.
<<&&&&>>
The camera was damaged when I got it. Thought it was just dirty for a while and later found out it was water damage.
<<&&&&>>
En general bastante bien
<<&&&&>>
It was a used phone , scratch , apps store doesn’t work and so many.
<<&&&&>>
I was buying 64gb iPhone 6s but they sent me 16gb iPhone 6s which is not good , I am sending back the phone
<<&&&&>>
The phone not holding a charge It might be a battery issue. But not sure
<<&&&&>>
the box is very bad.the headphone hole is dirty，screen also has some unusual plots.it should be a retreading machine.I am very disappointed with it.I will never buy other things on amazon.
<<&&&&>>
The mobile is perfect but the only bad part that it came with no box no headphones and not original charger
<<&&&&>>
Speaker doesn't work and you can only take calls on speakerphone. Battery life is less than 2 hours. Terrible refurb.
<<&&&&>>
Purchased for my daughter's birthday. She loves it! Works great and looks like new.
<<&&&&>>
Had an issue with the charger that was included. Didnt charge the phone. Also, came with a screen protector preinstalled.
<<&&&&>>
Battery was shot on this phone. Battery has only 53% battery life.
<<&&&&>>
Exelente por el precio
<<&&&&>>
Battery is basically dead. How do you not refurbish that of all things?
<<&&&&>>
Really good product
<<&&&&>>
Replacement purchase, refurbished unit. Looks like new. Works well, but runs through battery pretty fast.
<<&&&&>>
Battery is not so good
<<&&&&>>
It came in as expected.
<<&&&&>>
I dislike that it was small
<<&&&&>>
Worked great. No issues or problems. Worked with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
Amazing product it was fully unlocked and great price but the battery is not the best but it’s still good
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono no sirve no se escucha nada y está un golpe tiene
<<&&&&>>
I gave it to my 11-year old
<<&&&&>>
Works well so far, the speaker isn't very loud though. Smooth transaction
<<&&&&>>
The home button not working. shut down and restart by itself. I charged it for almost 2 hours and the battery life is still 9%. This is horrible
<<&&&&>>
Apple said that the touch ID is broken and it's not even refurbished
<<&&&&>>
Llego todo bien sin novedad
<<&&&&>>
item worked fine, wrong item!
<<&&&&>>
Great phone, nothing to complain about. Good deal, works well.
<<&&&&>>
I put in my SIM card onto the phone, but it keeps telling me that I don't have service even though my SIM card works perfectly.
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone, although there are minor scratches, it’s barely noticeably and it’s still looks brand new! The quality is really nice and the battery doesn’t die fast!
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone for money looked like new
<<&&&&>>
In good condition. Just one button is failing sometimes.
<<&&&&>>
Battery

<<&&&&>>
I love the color of my new ROSE GOLD I-phone 6S; and the features are all working well.
<<&&&&>>
Was decent enough when we received it for a used piece, but stopped working after 3 months..
<<&&&&>>
Beware, you can not turn off camera sounds with these phones. They apparently were not made for the US market.
<<&&&&>>
no unlock
<<&&&&>>
Excelente producto
<<&&&&>>
It is running well! Delivered as informed!
<<&&&&>>
Hello, this phone is slow and your screen does not respond quite often. I would like to return this phone.

Battery was messed up

the mute switch doesn’t do it. i’ve restarted it several times and still nothing. i want this fixed. other than that though everything is fine.
<<&&&&>>
the battery is poor funcional. doesn’t last a day and I’m not using it at all yet.
<<&&&&>>
Estoy contenta con mi celular

Arrived quickly and works perfectly. No physical defects.
<<&&&&>>
Compre un iPhone 6S plus de 64GB y me llegó de 16GB, ahora como lo puedo cambiar si el envío era para Venezuela?
<<&&&&>>
The phone is damaged with dents and scratches. The cover color and accessories look fake and not apple. Im processing the return
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies super fast, all I have to do is unlock my phone. I’m not happy with it at all
<<&&&&>>
Muy buen equipo mi hija está muy contenta del el

<<&&&&>>
It's all good. I don't have time for rating.
<<&&&&>>

The battery would not hold a charge even when off.
<<&&&&>>
It looks nice, I will just have to spend more $$ on a new battery
<<&&&&>>

The phone was in great cosmetic condition and no issues with the phone.

Really nice iPhone. I love it.

<<&&&&>>
I like its cheap price,i like having mobile with this beautiful case,it looks like the new one exactly
<<&&&&>>
Speaker is blown out of the box.
<<&&&&>>
Screen shutters occasionally.
<<&&&&>>
Works well
<<&&&&>>
Review for the 6S 64Gb, refurbished, rose gold. Excellent condition with no signs of wear or use! Phone received in a box similar to the original with a simple screen protector (for shipping), replacement charger and cable (non OEM). Everything looks new and works properly-phone was fully unlocked. Only negative, but which is totally acceptable is that the battery is slightly weak (83%) as per the new (beta) Battery status in IOS 11.3. Performance of the phone is not impacted much however. The phone had the previous version so this information was probably not available to the seller. Plan to visit the Genius Bar to have that replaced soon. Overall, all my expectations were met!
<<&&&&>>
Todo perfecto pero la batería dura muy poco
<<&&&&>>
The battery suck. It cost me $70 to get it repaired
<<&&&&>>
A beautiful phone indeed, no problems. Great fast shipping.
<<&&&&>>
Works great so far!
<<&&&&>>
all around happy with the phone
<<&&&&>>
Voice is not clear when we are making voice call.
<<&&&&>>
This phone met all of my expectations!
<<&&&&>>
The battery is easy to gone.
<<&&&&>>
Crap.
<<&&&&>>
Battery was only at 81% when bought.
<<&&&&>>
The camera came whit defect
<<&&&&>>
it has a very short battery life, but overall the phone works well.
<<&&&&>>
clean
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
In the post it says that’s is a 64GB but it’s actually just 16GB
<<&&&&>>
such
<<&&&&>>
Wonderful product
<<&&&&>>
I love the IPhone 6S. Great phone, wonderful customer service. Thanks alot
<<&&&&>>
wonderful
<<&&&&>>
Great purchase and I received the item in a very timely manner.
<<&&&&>>
SO BAD
<<&&&&>>
Poor battery health and touch glitches at times
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
good~
<<&&&&>>
The life's battery isn't so good...
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
The phone works ok but the battery lasts 3 hours at the most! Don’t buy it.
<<&&&&>>
Was ordering for daughter, but she didn't tell me there was a + with the 6s. So was too small for her cases. Sorry.
<<&&&&>>
I have purchased TWO iPhone 6's from this seller. 7 months later and NO issues. Came as if they were brand new, fast shipping and original Apple chargers. Could not be happier! Will buy from again.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and it worked pretty good for a while, then after normal battery use the battery was completely burned out. I talked to Apple/ Verizon and told them about the issue and they snail that they know about it and have gotten many complaints about the battery life issue. It’s stupid that they know about it and don’t make a change, I would go from 100% to 20% in less than 2 hours of barely using the phone, I would recommend getting a android phone because 1 they are cheaper 2 they last longer 3 they are much more cost efficient.
<<&&&&>>
Absolutely do not buy this phone. I lent my girlfriend money to buy this, and she got it with no battery life, shed have to keep it on a charger to keep it alive, then she replaced the battery and now it's in boot loop and wont update. I want my money back
<<&&&&>>
Unfortunately I received the phone a day later than expected and got the wrong color as well as a few small scratches inside the phone. A bit disappointed but seems to be working fine.
<<&&&&>>
It's a good product for the price except the battery. It drains out quickly. Everything else is great.
<<&&&&>>
Absolutely the worst experience of my digital life. Battery life sucks. Like, its terrible. User interface doesn't hold a candle to android. That all might have given it 3 stars, since it does have some redeeming features, but the Apple ID won it a 1 star rating. I can't describe how aggravating it is to be prompted every morning to enter my apple ID. And then when I go to get something from the app store, I have to enter a password which always turns out to be wrong. Then it takes an act of Congress to get it to reset my password. I don't want a damn Apple id. I have a google acct, and if apple can't figure a way to incorporate that into its products, I'm done. Oh, and you can't even change the damn 9-minute snooze! I mean, wtf? And don't get me started on the new iphones not having a head phone jack....
<<&&&&>>
I want a free sample
<<&&&&>>
Freeze up and restarts on its own. I don't understand why or how but I'm disappointed and dissatisfied as a consumer. I need some answers or swap for another iphone please.
<<&&&&>>
Review update: After a week of use I noticed some grainy issues with the rear camera. I’ve cleaned it several times and there are no scratches so I’m assuming dust was left inside the body of the phone and has migrated over top of the lense. Otherwise, I love it! Just wish I could use all features. I originally got it to have a good camera to use to take pictures for my business but obviously it’s not going to be able to be used for that now. I’ve had it 20 days now and attached images of the cameras quality as of now(just keeps getting dustier/worse). Original: The pin needle sized nick on the back and a pin needle sized scratch next to one of the screws on the bottom but otherwise the phone is in PERFECT shape! I swapped SIM cards from my old phone and got this baby up and running in just a few minutes! I’m reviewing using it!
<<&&&&>>
Tech Ventures lied to me. After being very cooperate exchanging iPhone for a Note 5, then assuring me a GOOD Note 5, I learned that the rep on the phone has NO IMPUT as to which Note 5 would sent to me. Her call goes to a warehouse where the cell is simply removed from the storage location. I received the first model of the Note 5. Trust me, NOT TECH VENTURES...this Note 5 is a mess except for e-audio books; no email/gmail & it changes words at will. They really dropped the ball.
<<&&&&>>
When I fist got this phone, I thought it was a great price and happy to have it and it worked great. After a few months, the phone will not hold a charge. Sometime for only a few minuets. I made sure I was using a Apple cet. charger and I was. I wrote to the company that sold me the phone, Kanga Supply. they said to me, that they could not even give me advice or talk to me because the warranty ran out. I explained I was not looking to return, I just wanted advice as to why this was happening. Again Kanga Supply responded with they cannot even speak to me. seriously!!! Dont purchase from this company.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my daughter to replace her iPhone SE. Other than being a newer phone with more GB, we really aren't impressed. The battery life is horrible. Granted she's on it a lot but it's slow to charge and drains quickly. I really don't think this phone was worth the money as there were a lot of other options that could have been purchased for less, but I really wanted to get her the pink one so it's my own fault. I'd skip over buying a used iPhone 6s if you can avoid it.
<<&&&&>>
Just what I wanted to replace an iPhone 6. The user of this claims there's a screen blemish but I can't see it. Phone works fine except for the battery life being down to 66%. I did anticipate that given the age of these things and had the battery replaced by Apple for $49. Overall satisfied with the purchase of this.
<<&&&&>>
I needed a replacement for my 6s that was only 16GB. This same phone, refurbished, on AT&T's website was $500. Got the phone and took it into the AT&T store. They were able to simply swap out my existing SIM card and voila it was like I never got a new phone. Same model means you don't have to buy a SIM card. Totally unlocked and works fine on AT&T network. Plus AT&T took my old phone as a trade-in and gave me $45 for it. WINNING!
<<&&&&>>
I dislike that I could not use iTunes regardless of all the videos on YouTube I watched I could not resolve the cannot connect to iTunes. That prevented me from downloading videos/music. The phone came without no scratch and I have been using and no other issue so far apart from not being able to connect on ITunes. I will review again if necessary.
<<&&&&>>
The item description claimed, " The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away, batteries with at least 80% capacity relative to new." When we received the phone, the battery health indicated 76%. We took it to a battery service provider which hooked it up to an iPhone heath program, they showed 60%. We could have returned the phone, but decided to just pay for a new battery rather than deal with the hassle of returning the phone, and transferring data into another phone that might have worse problems then the one we received. After replacing the battery, the phone works great!
<<&&&&>>
Phone did not work correctly. Kept losing charge and would freeze. Battery status was at 82%. Apple support said it sounded like it needed a new battery and I could go to Best Buy. Only Best Buy refuses to work on refurbished phones so I ended up sending it to Apple. Apple sent it back without repairing because they found evidence of damage caused by contact with liquid. I had one day left to return to Amazon so I sent back. Do not buy from this seller.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived on time in very good condition and works as expected. This phone was a replacement for a damaged phone and was restored using iCloud backup, but the process seemed to work better using a direct connection to iTunes on my Mac. Package included a compatible USB charger and cable plus a screen protector
<<&&&&>>
The battery life was absolutely crap, I had to charge the thing 4 times (full 100% charge) the first day I got it. The touch screen was also mega iffy. I sent it back after 3 days.
<<&&&&>>
My Samsung Galaxy refused to charge anymore so I had no choice but to get a new phone so I went back to an Iphone. I waited a while to give my review because I wanted to make sure that it was going to work good. So far, so good. I don't have any complaints yet.
<<&&&&>>
This iPhone is perfect for me. I paired it with Tracfone “bring your own phone” service and it works great. The customer service from the seller is excellent! Battery life on this iPhone model is known to be sho that is not the seller’s fault.
<<&&&&>>
The delivery was faster than expected by a week. But the phone itself has scratches at the top part. Worse still is the battery that died off very quickly. Although phone is cheap but battery is already unusable and has to be replaced.
<<&&&&>>
I am so very pleased with this phone!! It lasted me 6 years and the only reason I changed to a new one is the battery life would run out after a full day of usage. But after six years I would have expected it to decline a lot more quickly. And I was able to resell it for a decent price. Defiantly worth the money!!
<<&&&&>>
I bought this I phone 6s for my wife as a replacement phone. The price is fair and the delivery was fast. I also got it with screen protectors and a rubber case. I feel like it was a great value and most importantly, my wife loves it !
<<&&&&>>
Love it! Have no problems with it works great and worked with my straight talk with no issues.
<<&&&&>>
Second time I have purchased a refurbished iPhone from Amazon, never had problems either time. In hindsight, I would not recommend paying extra for the rose gold color, which I did, just use the money to get a nice case to protect it if dropped.
<<&&&&>>
Battery does not seem to hold charge like new but works. The touch screen seems to glitch sometimes but for the dollar it’s ok.
<<&&&&>>
Sometimes I think the older models do so much it’s had to justify a newer one. This one has worked well since I got it. My wife uses it daily. I have a newer on but it’s twice the price and I see no advantage.
<<&&&&>>
This was an older iphone, so I knew what I was getting after years of reviews. Everything worked nicely without breaking the bank.
<<&&&&>>
ok doesnt work like a new one after 4 mo getting worse, beware this product stinks , use another source . this company sends krap
<<&&&&>>
arrived quickly in like new condition. I have sprint so I bought the “fully unlocked “ phone. Activation was easy on the my sprint account page. Was worried it wouldn’t work for sprint but no issues so far.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is listed as compatible with Verizon but it’s not. Verizon was unable to set it up. I gave two stars because shipping was fast, phone looks great, properly packaged. Just doesn’t work on Verizon network as advertised. Hopefully I’ll be fully refunded promptly once I return the phone.
<<&&&&>>
fully charged over night, with three hours of basic minimal use, battery was down to 30%, send back for a refund.
<<&&&&>>
Bought it to use as a trade in on the 11 for my husband.
<<&&&&>>
Certified refurbished but the call volume is very low, barely loud enough even when on speaker phone.
<<&&&&>>
Beware of buying from this seller. I do not know how they do it, but just after the 90 days warranty it shorted during the night. Nothing more than an expensive paperweight now. Buy at your own risk.
<<&&&&>>
The battery was not new, but the condition of the phone was really good.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my goddaughter I have no dislikes, shes very happy with the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Battery had to be replaced after two months. But phone has otherwise worked great. Better than looking for one off craigslist.
<<&&&&>>
Burn mark on camera that wasn’t immediately noticeable. No option to repair. Will have to return for refund and purchase another questionable quality product.
<<&&&&>>
She loves the phone. Not sure how long the battery lasts. She's literally staring at it all day but does charge it often.
<<&&&&>>
Don't buy a defective "refurbished" product from this seller. The phone died within 5 months of purchase, and Apple says that it is not possible to repair, since the issue is with damage to the charging port during the refurbishing.
<<&&&&>>
no problem! does what it's supposed to do, without any complaint.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
Because the product is being sent overseas, I dont have any history of the product, becuse it is not activitated.
<<&&&&>>
Good price for a fully unlocked phone display has a few pixels that are brighter than the rest
<<&&&&>>
Would like a stronger battery, but a good phone in great shape for the price
<<&&&&>>
It is working good so far. But not good as new.
<<&&&&>>
Speakers didn't work, wasted my time purchasing "certified refurbished" phones when I should've shopped around more and paid for a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
This phone was advertised as “tested to work and look like new”. In general, that was true. But the battery capacity was very poor and we had to replace it. Other then the battery, the phone is great.
<<&&&&>>
Battery less than 85%
<<&&&&>>
Good phone, good price
<<&&&&>>
After my phone accidentally went for a swim I was thankful this one arrived so quickly and at a much better price than a brand new one. It works like new!
<<&&&&>>
Phone works perfect. Thank you
<<&&&&>>
This one had issues from the start just didn't do well and then quit working!
<<&&&&>>
It was a gift for my little brother and he loves it
<<&&&&>>
Not impressed. Phone has gone blank and had to try and restart to get a screen again. It’s slow. Battery only lasts a half a day with minimal use. Disappointed
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in condition as described. 2 months later and it is still working great.
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy this phone! I purchased this phone 90 days ago and suddenly stopped working. Third party vendor now saying I must seek repair with manufacturer. Total deception, Consumer Fraud.
<<&&&&>>
nice phone, delivered quickly. works well in South Africa when I travelled
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
Bought the phone for my cousin in Belize and it's not unlocked. Worste thing they fail to unlock the phone
<<&&&&>>
Couple scratches on the screen. Scratched on the corner
<<&&&&>>
Phone got very hot and won’t hold a charge
<<&&&&>>
nice deal
<<&&&&>>
Very nice and looks like 100% new phone except the packing box. No problem to use in Hong Kong.
<<&&&&>>
Finger print is not working. I returned it
<<&&&&>>
Everything worked like it said.
<<&&&&>>
Have had the phone for about a month and the home button is already sticking
<<&&&&>>
At first, I was reluctant to purchase an Apple IPhone, I thought it cost too much. however, after I purchased this IPhone, I do not think I could ever see myself with any phone other than an IPhone. This phone rocks.
<<&&&&>>
So far a easy to operate device .
<<&&&&>>
I am very pleased with my purchase and grateful I was able to get a quality phone at such a low price. I at first had doubts but now I have many smiles. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Very good product. Very satisfied and will be back in the future. Nicely done ✅
<<&&&&>>
Bought it brand new from Apple website. 7 months later it was stolen. Cops can trace it to Brownsville Brooklyn but can't recover it. It's locked and as useless as a paperweight. IPhones suck in many ways. They're only good for getting stolen. But I guess some people just like the white color if it.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this I phone on March 19, 2018, I have not had any problems with it until now after the 90 day warranty is up, today I used the phone on my lunch break to order lunch and 20 minutes later the phone locked up, the home button could not be depressed, The phone keeps attempting to shut down and re-boot itself, it gets hot, now the phone lost power, I am trying to charge it up but not sure I will be successful if it keeps trying to reboot. I would like a replacement ASAP I paid too much money for this to happen and not have working phone, please advise!!!!
<<&&&&>>
This iphone7 plus is supposed to be a 256gb it's only a 32gb. It is supposed to be certified refurbished and unlocked. It apparently isn't unlocked because the phone is not compatible with my carrier and can't help me.
<<&&&&>>
Ok first phone came looked good worked great! Then boom charger (apple branded) gets hot next thing you know nothing will charge the phone, oh best part is it was not the battery it was the clip and the motherboard melted down!!! Said that parts where replaced and bad I paid $200 to fix this phone! I could have got a brand new 8 + for what I paid for this phone plus that $200 will not recommend anyone by an iPhone on amazon ever!
<<&&&&>>
The advertising said unlock but it was not and the process was totally inconvenient when I needed my phone ASAP.
<<&&&&>>
I was skeptical about ordering an iPhone from anywhere but apple because I read so many horror stories about what could be wrong with them. But after a little research I ordered one from these guys and it is 99.9% perfect. Delivery was quick and the ONLY thing that I can tell that makes it not brand new is a TINY ding on the back. I don’t care about that one bit though. Gotta have a case on these anyway. So glad I ordered from these guys
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived in a plain white box. It’s got the charging devices inside it. However, it’s got a scratch in the middle of the screen. Its got several scratches on the back of the phone are beside the front facing camera. I’ve also observed it to be quite filthy around the edges. Its got this brown sediment trapped around the edge. It does not look renewed/refurbished. This is basically second hand, just a little worse. I’m terribly disappointed by this purchase and I will be returning it. I don’t trust Amazon’s phone renewal service anymore...
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit nervous buying a refurbished phone, especially after reading reviews that said it wasn’t compatible with certain service providers, but I decided to take the first chance I’ve ever made and splurge because of how cheap it was. Although the battery health is at only 89%, that’s the only slight problem I recieved. It was clean and looked brand new, and the setup was very easy. I’ll give updates after months of usage to see how this phone continues to work for me over time!
<<&&&&>>
Love the large screen! Apple goofed when they eliminated the separate jack for head phones forcing you to choose, charge or listen. Button is HIGHLY sensitive and often unlocks when I just want to check the time. Lots of memory and slim design.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this iPhone few years ago and it still works like it's brand new. As long as you take care of it, its worth it.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this phone since my carrier is verizon and it is advertised as "GSM unlocked" but this phone is not unlocked. It only works with ATT & T-mobile so if you have any other carrier DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Super upset about this
<<&&&&>>
Love the care in packaging and it came with a screen protector pre-installed, could have been listed as a selling point, and it's actually finger print resistant. Device is perfect and couldn't be happier with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Well the phone works just fine, but the battery life is at the bare minimum they advertise(80%). There are no scratches on the screen or camera lens(awesome), but there are some scuffs and scratches around the lens on the case of the phone(bummer).Also there is some dirt or grime in between the top of the screen and the aluminum body of the phone as well as a bunch of dust/dirt in the speakers of phone(yikes). Overall it’s a functioning upgrade from a 5s but wish more care was taken in cleaning and refurbishing phone like advertised.

I get the phone is used but come on now ... the screen is this badly scratched. You would think they would at least replace that since it’s capable of doing. Highly don’t recommend, phone has more then just simple minimum signs of use . Now I don’t even time to return because it’s a gift for Christmas for my mom so now I gotta waste even more to fix the screen.
<<&&&&>>
The product was defective, battery damaged and lcd screen not responding after couple of weeks took it to Apple store and there is no solution but to get a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Products were advertised as fully unlocked Verizon phones, but would not work on verizon
<<&&&&>>
Came fully charged, everything is working great!
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Very happy with my new apple device. Befor I use samsung s8+. Now I will never go back to android. fast, smart, easy to use and beautiful iphone. Recommend to everyone. No damage, no scratches. 9 from 10.
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself works just as it should. However, I did notice the bottom and top of the phone were pretty badly chipped and scrapped up and I also noticed that the phone wasn’t even cleaned as you could still see the residue line that the previous case it had left on it.
<<&&&&>>
Although it's sold as renewed, the one I got looked brand new and unused.. it must be an overstock unused item. I put in the SIM card from my 6+ and everything worked perfectly. I'm impressed.
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy from this. Phone says unlocked, got it and it was still locked to Verizon. Call verizon and they can't do anything, so have to get a refund!!
<<&&&&>>
I have had this phone for over 1 year and it has never given me any kind of problems!! I love it! It’s exactly as described.
<<&&&&>>
When I read "works and looks like new", I expected better. It works fine, but does not look like new. There are numerous scratches on the screen. I chose this over a "refurbished" iPhone, and paid quite a bit more for it. I wish I had just bought the refurbished one and saved the extra $50.
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone. I gave it a 4 overall because it came with a scratch on the back. I understand it's refurbished and these things can be expected, but that's why i gave it a four star rating. Other than the scratch on the back, everything seems to work fine so far!
<<&&&&>>
I got for my wife she loves it
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the iPhone 7 plus 256gig. After reading all these reviews I was scared and worried that I just spent a lot of money on a fake. Well I just received it today and it is indeed real and unlocked. I slid my Verizon SIM card in and it is working flawlessly. Ordered from theprunedanish
<<&&&&>>
Got the phone and it was great ! Looks like new. I was a little skeptical based on some other reviews but I am completely satisfied. Arrived on time. Comes with a generic charger, no headphones. Battery life is 91% which isn’t bad for a used phone. I don’t have any complaints ! Would deff recommend.
<<&&&&>>
I have to admit i was a little scared to order a refurbed phone but it works beautifully! You would never know that it was not brand new except the packaging.
<<&&&&>>
What a great item 1st time buying a iPhone 7 Plus renewed I have no problems with the phone the phone is in mint condition no scratches or nothing I could definitely recommend to friends and family
<<&&&&>>
Upgrade from my 6s that I have had for 4 years. Hope this one gives me the same amount of service
<<&&&&>>
Son has been using this for 5 months and no problems. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
There was no ear phone and whatsapp sound....I don't know when I receive messages on u whatsapp....There r d things I didn't like and I hope these are d only complain I might have for the phone. The paper it came with is very blurted....
<<&&&&>>
First day with phone. Was delivered fast. Seems to work fine so far other than the speaker sounds a little off. But over all the phone is in good condition. No scratches or dents. No problem switching phone on my metro/t mobile network. Was a att phone.
<<&&&&>>
It even came with a screen protector on it.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent replacement phone; works like new.
<<&&&&>>
I was so nervous to purchase this phone off here now that I got it’s been working really goood had for a month now still waiting for it to act up it hasn’t hopefully it doesn’t but for as of now I LOVE It
<<&&&&>>
I don’t like that they sent me a phone with little small stratches on the screen and then tried to use tempered glass to disguise it, but everything else works fine so far, hope there are not any other hidden problems in the future .
<<&&&&>>
Don’t care the bad reviews. The phone was more than i expected. It works great and no scratches on the screen. It was unlocked as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
The product works as expected except the charger provided takes forever to charge the unit it literally takes hours
<<&&&&>>
Ever since day 1 when I got this phone it has killed the battery and I have to charge it twice a day just to get though the day!!
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone
<<&&&&>>
Works as expected... no scratches or signs of usage. Great phone and performance.. no issues at all
<<&&&&>>
Product looked better than new. I was skeptical about buying refurbished It surpassed my expectations.
<<&&&&>>
once it’s on speaker phone it’s hard for the other person to hear.
<<&&&&>>
The battery charges quick, the iPhone I got came as described too. Perfect for me. The charger cord is apple but not the box.
<<&&&&>>
Despite the description this is not universally unlocked. The equipment prevents use with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
Just a little scratch but its perfect
<<&&&&>>
I’m new to iOS, and have long preferred Android products. So far so good
<<&&&&>>
Mom loves it
<<&&&&>>
I love my iPhone 7 Plus! It seems BRAND NEW!
<<&&&&>>
Works great!
<<&&&&>>
No scratches at all battery life was at 80% when I opened settings but that’s cool bc it is a USED phone great price tho I’ll buy my next phone from. Them
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my sister she had the same phone previously and she absolutely loves it loves loves loves it thank you so much
<<&&&&>>
The keypad is not wirking properly once you press a letter different letter comes out
<<&&&&>>
I love it n my son will love it to . The phone is perfect n so are your prices. Thank you I won't shop any where else
<<&&&&>>
Best buy ever , if you want a great iPhone get , mine only hand a miss color in the screen which is fine only shows up when there is black on the screen , love the phone tho
<<&&&&>>
Ok
<<&&&&>>
The phone freezes up when your typing or it won’t type at all. For the amount paid it shouldn’t be doing that.
<<&&&&>>
Currently using this phone. Had it for about a month now and it’s really good.
<<&&&&>>
Very good, I had no issues Since I had it.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone for a great price
<<&&&&>>
Like new. Got this 2 weeks now and works great. Came with screen protector.
<<&&&&>>
Calls and emails an text
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with this iphone
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived in excellent “new” like condition. Works great.
<<&&&&>>
The original charger did not come with the device and does not exist Hand Free
<<&&&&>>
I love my new phone!!!!
<<&&&&>>
Works fine up till now (1 month) Didn’t come in the original box and without catalogue and headphones but it is much cheaper than the new one
<<&&&&>>
good stuff
<<&&&&>>
I got my phone thanks
<<&&&&>>
Love it
<<&&&&>>
Works good a few scratches around the top but it’s in perfect condition
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
Good condition
<<&&&&>>
I like the battery life.
<<&&&&>>
Why would you pay twice the price just to unbox this thing? Buy refurbished!
<<&&&&>>
Was in excellent condition really love it
<<&&&&>>
Perfect
<<&&&&>>
It’s a nice phone and is good condition,however I’ve only had the phone for just about 1 month and it already started freezing up when I press the numbers or buttons and when I try to type it types in it’s own letters or numbers that I have not even press or my tubs were not close to. Also when dailing numbers to make a phone call this phone does it’s own thing. I don’t think it’s a brand new phone I think this was something that was used and redux. I paid 750 for this phone and it wasn’t up to my expectations.
<<&&&&>>
Works great. Looks new no complaints
<<&&&&>>
All good, the item works perfectly! Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Looks beautiful. Besides loving the rose gold look, women take much better care of their phones so this phone looked brand new though refurbished. I bought a screen protector and a case for this phone at the same time of purchasing this. I couldn't imagine making an investment of this size without spending at least a reasonable amount to protect that investment. IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to this from an older phone you will need to get a nano sim card as the old larger sims won't work in this phone. (Call your carrier e.g. Verizon, AT&T to get your nano sim) Review: 2017.09.06
<<&&&&>>
Perfect. Just what I ordered. As good as new, but without the price tag...
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
Is the best phone
<<&&&&>>
I love it😍❤️
<<&&&&>>
Someone returned that phone and then sent it to me it's already used and jacked up. The charger and etc. is not complete for my $749. I need a refill NOW.
<<&&&&>>
Ok. This is truly an unlocked phone. I have used it in 2 different countries so far with no problems. Just purchase a sim chip at the airport and here I go. I am back in communication with everyone. Lots of storage and beautiful color. Easy to move everything off my iPhone 6plus. It takes great pictures and the sound is really good. I am very pleased with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Came without the earbuds.
<<&&&&>>
This iPhone was worth to buy I recommend it. I don't have it but I really want one. My friend told me that this phone was great and I really Really want one so I can use it myself. I really want a phone that I own but I never will. I just want to ask if you could ship me one thanks. -Carmen
<<&&&&>>
I thought that this item would arrive with a headset. It didn’t. Great product all the same. Works amazingly looks great. Great purchase
<<&&&&>>
Perfect. Looks brand new. Battery health 96%. Passed all my tests with flying colors.
<<&&&&>>
The camera and flash would not work on this phone. So disappointed when I got it. Everything else looked good. Phone looked brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Reconditioned iPhone 7 Plus in great condition, good price and delivered on time. That’s what I want from a seller, perfect. Thanks.
<<&&&&>>
It is what expected! I am happy with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Such a great phone had it for about 6 months now it works really well, Was worth the 475$
<<&&&&>>
Way to expensive
<<&&&&>>
I love this phone it's so good and I haven't broken it once
<<&&&&>>
Hey I have a YouTube channel where I talk about the specs on the new hottest phones out and would love if you could send me a sample of the iPhone above thanks
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived on time and appeared to be fine, everything worked, but when I contact Verizon they told the the IMEI number was not on the list of compatible phones and so I could not activate it. I'm returning it. Disappointing, the description clearly says unlocked to work with CDMA, which implies it works with Verizon since they are the only major company using CDMA.
<<&&&&>>
Phone description claims to be 256 GB clearly it is 128. Payed more for the larger option. False advertisement!
<<&&&&>>
I was hesitant to order a refurbed phone fearing scratches, etc. This one came carefully wrapped with no scratches. It looked totally brand new. The only giveaway was that the battery is at 88%. Small price to pay for the phone since with tax and shipping Apple's price is close to $800 vs. the $464 I paid. I have been an Android user for years and replaced an excellent Umidigi Z1 Pro for the Apple. Hate the IOS. Transferring files is a total pain having to use iCloud, iTunes, etc. to move files vs. a direct transfer with the Android. Also, my favorite ring tones will not transfer. Movies also a problem with some transferring. Image shown with protective case.
<<&&&&>>
Upgrading from a 5S. Not a fan of not having a headphone jack but some wireless Bluetooth earbuds work just fine. .The camera is something else. The only negative I've noticed is the WiFi range seems a bit weaker than my 5S.
<<&&&&>>
I like the color and price. It comes with a box ( not original box!)
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone on the expected date, it has some bumps on the borders and a crack in the home button.
<<&&&&>>
I love my new I phone 7 plus.Got a great price. New to Apple I love it
<<&&&&>>
That's all that is an iPhone 7 plus. It works perfectly. There is a micro scratch on the screen but it doesn't bother at all. Delivery is quick as expected. I recommand it
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked fine for one week. Now it only charges half way and keeps going back to setup. Conclusion - Buying refurbished is paying for someone else's problems.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent deal, great product; it was a gift for my wife and she loves it. I would definitely do business with you again.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is great but it's missing head phone and original charger
<<&&&&>>
I really like this phone. Good size. Memory is great . Camera is good. Price is good. Phone looks new. I only email . Text. And message. This is perfect phone for me.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone!
<<&&&&>>
very bad battery
<<&&&&>>
Excellent
<<&&&&>>
Thank you! This phone is working awesome!! Sending this review from it now! 👍🏼
<<&&&&>>
Bought it for a member of the family and they are pleased.
<<&&&&>>
Awsome really nice iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Works great
<<&&&&>>
There is only one tiny problem that the speaker is not as clear as I was expected. Camera is good; Battery is good; and everything else seems to be good.
<<&&&&>>
I am very dissappointed with the phone. The battery life and the touch screen are not as given in the description. The casing also has scratches.
<<&&&&>>
Works like new. Very good condition. No problems other than I wish it came with ear buds at this price.
<<&&&&>>
It works perfectly, except for the cable and adaptor (it came with a HTC adaptor!).
<<&&&&>>
Thanks!
<<&&&&>>
Yes. My daughter loves it. As of yet no issues. Thanks
<<&&&&>>
One main reason why you should never buy refurbished iPhones or Amazon Trade-In program for iPhones or Electronics is because they always end up having problems or being under graded saying it's at 9 or 10 when you receive the product it's more like a 5 or 4 with scratches and chips and they send you cheap Chinese knock-off Chargers and cables because they can't send you the original Apple Chargers which is required properly to charge your phone without damaging the battery
<<&&&&>>
This phone is NOT unlocked. I am on Verizon and it does not work, I checked the IMEI number and it is not compatible with the network. False advertising, and now I have to wait to return it and order Another one from a different site for the right phone to come. Very disappointing!
<<&&&&>>
Got this phone this month and only just tested it as I’ve been traveling. The back camera doesn’t work at all and I will be returning it as soon as I’m back to the US
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the Iphone 7 plus 128gb gold and got exactly that. Not only did I save hundreds but the phone is perfect! I love it. update: I’m really disappointed. I was really happy since the phone was in such a great condition. But after a day of use I noticed the camera won’t take pictures. When I call someone, or receive calls it doesn’t always go in. So sad because it’s actually great otherwise.
<<&&&&>>
The button control, in the front, some times not working properly... I try send back, to refund, but I need travel with this IPhone with this problem, because I don’t have time to wait to change.
<<&&&&>>
Bought two phones for Santa presents and they are not unlocked for Verizon. Very disappointed. Do not buy if you need to set up with Verizon carrier.
<<&&&&>>
Good!
<<&&&&>>
This phone looks and operates like it is new.
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
The phone is good and works great
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked fine at first. Home button stopped working after a month or so. Parts of the screen became unresponsive several months after that. Would not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is not unlocked I’m really disappointed
<<&&&&>>
When you press home button we can hear audible click with loud noise.
<<&&&&>>
the charger is not original and the box. overall condition for the mobile is good
<<&&&&>>
Buen producto
<<&&&&>>
A gift
<<&&&&>>
Where the charger its adaptor only?!!
<<&&&&>>
This is the second phone I’ve purchased through this seller. All in all the phone is in great condition. All the buttons work well the screen looks great. The only problem I have really is that I’m the cracks of the screen on the sides where it meets the backing is dirty. Otherwise I’m still a happy customer. There are some scuffs on the corners but being a refurbished phone I don’t expect it to be in mint condition.
<<&&&&>>
Product description said that the phone was in the mint condition, 100% like new product. The screen had two cracks. This is frustrating and unpleasant. Amazon should have better management of their brand since they are putting their name for this program and partner with this ridiculous small company who are trying to welch customers.
<<&&&&>>
Almost all the higher grade iPhones work the same! I got it to use with more Home app.and longer battery life! Time will prevail!
<<&&&&>>
Excellent product as advertised. Had it for about 2 or more weeks and phone works wonderfully. Love it
<<&&&&>>
Great phone for the price,
<<&&&&>>
Works well love it
<<&&&&>>
Touch Screen Stopped working after a month, and did not get a refund or an exchange.
<<&&&&>>
The mic on this phone (iPhone 7 plus black) didn’t work. What a hassle. Of course you won’t find this out until you put service in it and try to make calls. If no one can hear you, what’s the point of the phone? Which means I had to take service off of my old phone, put the service on this phone. Take it off of this phone, because it’s not working, out it on another phone that works, spend hours in the Apple store just to have them tell me that the problem can’t be fixed. The whole phone has to be replaced. All this before going out of the country on a trip. Yeah... it’s sucks. Buyer Beware!
<<&&&&>>
They didn’t even give me the phone I ordered. I ordered a jet black iPhone 7 Plus and received a gold white iPhone 6s Plus but I still had to pay for the iPhone 7 Plus price.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone on a whim when my other phone had broken. Many people say not to buy refurbished electronics, but I am very happy with my purchase. This phone is close to immaculate! the only signs of use are near the charging port where there is a little bit of scuffing. Another plus of my purchase was that the phone came with a pre-installed tempered glass screen protector, as well as a charging cord, and the charging block itself. The jet black color is in amazing condition for this phone being refurbished.
<<&&&&>>
Really pleasantly surprised. Phone looked pretty much brand new. Everything so far working great.. the battery life shows 93 percent or new. Edit: when I got the phone I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a glass screen protector.. after using awhile I noticed a weird small line in the middle of the screen which I examined closely and appeared to be due to the protector being damaged... unfortunately it was not the protector, there is a small line of dead pixels on the screen itself. In fairness I didn’t contact the seller as I didn’t know how big of a hassle it would be to swap out and for me to get all my personal info off of this phone. Kinda sucks because I notice it all the time now and I never have dropped this phone or anything since owning. Otherwise everything works well
<<&&&&>>
I love it! Battery life is amazing, battery health overall is at 95% ❤️ No scuffs, no cracks, touch ID works! Im so happy. I wish it could have came with an adapter but oh well all is well. An adapter is only like $10 and you could get some bluetooth headphones. I would upload pics of the phone but I no longer have my old phone. Just know, this phone is perfect so far. I will try to come back and update this review next month or so if I remember! But this phone is awesome
<<&&&&>>
3D touch doesn’t work, the screen feels and look not like an original Apple iphone 7 Plus screen, feels roughly and fingers go not smooth at all. Strange feeling when you use it , I put a glass screen protector and it works better, but is not how it needs to be, and 3D touch still NO WORKING!!! 😒👎
<<&&&&>>
I received my phone and it has 3 very noticeable scratches on the screen. I called customer service and all they wanted to do is ignore the fact that the description says "works and looks like new" and instead repeatedly refer to this statement 5 pages down in the description; no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away. Unfortunately, they do not seem to care that I can easily see all the scratch in this screen from arms length or more with the screen lit up or dark. This phone was supplied by BuySPRY.
<<&&&&>>
This was a great way to upgrade. Had tried 2 other 8 Plus phones from another company but both had problems. Wanted to upgrade to IOS 13. Maybe the phone—maybe the company? This 7 Plus is a great buy and works perfectly.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this phone on January 18 and it stopped working on me last Wednesday... I payed 400$ after taxes and shipping and it did not even last me a whole 6 months.... Did not drop it at all, had an otter box on it at all times, screen protector on, and the phone looks MINT condition. Went to apple to find out it has a hardware malfunction and that they could not fix it. It would not even let them restore/update the phone and I now have to buy a new one. Never again am I buying a refurbished iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my daughter for Xmas. I read A LOT of Q&A's to make sure that whatever I chose, it was in as best condition that I could find and unlocked so that she would be able to connect to her service. Everything I went through on this phone was exactly what I was looking for; however, she has not been able to connect it to her service because it keeps saying it is locked by verizon. She was told by verizon and apple that the phone is unlocked but when she puts in her sim card, it doesn't work. Apple tried to work with her to unlock it but was still unable to unlock. Now it seems we have to either look for a phone kit to hopefully fix the issue or return it so she can get something else. This is infuriating when we spent over $300 and now either possibly more or she has to go without a phone with a one year old at home so we can return it. I haven't been able to find how to contact them. Hopefully someone sees this and helps me fix it or I'm going to air mail it back to their office and not care where it lands.
<<&&&&>>
It was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. It also came with a screen protector already on that which is awesome. The battery life is amazing it is like new.
<<&&&&>>
When you expect to get a refurbished product, you only get a body cleaned phone. This iPhone 7 plus came with the audio ic disease. I can’t even have phone calls and I’m wondering what was refurbished though? and by the way the screen is 👎🏻 Noticeably low quality. Please don’t buy refurbished because you won’t get what you pay for unless it’s less than 50% of the market value.
<<&&&&>>
Estimated shipping was accurate. I have only had the black iPhone 7+, 128GB for approximately 12 hours & so far so good. Camera, microphone, battery, touch, etc. works well from my findings. You can most definitely see right off the bat that it’s used/refurbished due to very heavy nicks/dings around the edges of the phone. I still gave 4 stars because other than *minor* scuffs (considered cosmetic) everything else seems to be functioning to expectations. I will try to post pics but no promises.
<<&&&&>>
Bad experience with the phone I received. A side from the physical and visible damage, the phone would also freeze randomly and stay stuck on certain applications. The texting would also mess up very frequently, I would be texting and the delete (backspace) key would not work or cause the phone to go into another frozen state for about 45 to 60 seconds at a time. I also compared the phone to another iPhone 7 Plus and the screen has like a light blue tint. Ultimately I took it to the Apple store and traded it in as credit towards an iPhone XR. Do not get suckered into this.
<<&&&&>>
Product arrived in quoted time. The phone is flawless and truly fully unlocked. It came in a generic box with just the plug (don’t expect the Apple box with leaflets) - couldn’t have asked for more. Just what I needed. I would use this route again in near future!
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone 7+ came few days early and it works great so far. Battery was on 92% capacity which is pretty decent and it had screen protector on it! There are 2 minor scratches on the lower back on the phone which will be covered by any case regardless. I'll never buy a new phone from the store again!
<<&&&&>>
Phones sold here are NOT unlocked!!! Be aware before you order it may it may not work with your carrier !!! In my case I have a Sprint line and the phone I received was with another carrier . I had to return it.
<<&&&&>>
I was not sure to buy an used iphone, but now I can say that it was a good buy. It really loos and works like new. They even put a good screen protector. I recommend this seller.
<<&&&&>>
Works perfect, easy to use with my cricket sim card. Good value and long battery life. Very large in size however
<<&&&&>>
The phone it self was in great condition. First phone wasn't compatible with Verizon, Buy SPRY said sent it back we will send a replacement. Replacement was not compatible. Disappointing waste of time.
<<&&&&>>
Just received this not sure why so many bad reviews on this. My son is 14 I ordered for his Birthday 🎂 . He loves this phone my oldest daughter set it up for him. I'm very pleased . He plays fortnite on his and says the graphics are the best!!
<<&&&&>>
I love it! Works like new and exactly as described! Comes with new charger and cord in a box that is not original Apple box but is fine.
<<&&&&>>
Muy buen estado , solo algunos rasguños, solicite la factura urgente y nunca me la enviaron
<<&&&&>>
When I opened it I was wondering why did I get a brand new phone. It was as described maybe even better. I was a bit unsure as most of the reviews were negative but I'm very happy. It looked brand new. I would 100% recommend. I would be perfect if it had come in an Apple box but atleast I got a good phone. Click buy u won't regret
<<&&&&>>
Everything worked fine until I noticed nobody could hear me when talking on the phone. Microphone apparently defective. But seller was very good about prompt refund. Seller was trustworthy and prompt.
<<&&&&>>
Phone works perfectly no scratches no dents but the phone isn’t unlocked as stated 😒
<<&&&&>>
Bought for my husband. So far he likes it. He's coming from a Android so he had to get used to it. But works perfectly. No scratches, looks new.
<<&&&&>>
Works just like a brand new model. What a great deal?
<<&&&&>>
I was a skeptical buyer and asking myself to go for it or not? I decided to and I’m happy I did so, the phone was in new condition, no scratches or anything, everything was functional . I’ve been using it for a week now and I haven’t had any problems with it. I love my iPhone !😃
<<&&&&>>
Excelente la estética como nuevo
<<&&&&>>
50% battery life. It took four hours to get a full charge and less than 45 minutes to lose its charge entirely. And I ended up stiffed with the return shipping fees. The 3rd party seller blames everything on software. Awful experience.
<<&&&&>>
Phone looked and worked like brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Came earlier than expected, which was awesome because it ended up coming on my birthday! Looks like a brand new phone. One very, very little barely noticeable scratch on the back but that’s all I've seen and my case covers it. Was very worried to get this phone, but so far I'm very satisfied. 87% battery maximum capacity too!
<<&&&&>>
I really appreciated this refurbished IPhone. When I received it, the SIM card reader initially worked and then failed the second day. I went to my cellular vendor and obtained a new SIM card and the IPhone 7 Plus still not read the updated card. Am sure this was just a fluke. I have returned the device after approval from seller and continue to wait for refund.
<<&&&&>>
SO far so good no defects either and the fingerprint reader works well aswell
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this phone and for the first week it worked good. The second week after receiving it the screen was static and it continuously re-booted. I have send back the phone and requested a refund. I am still waiting for my refund
<<&&&&>>
The phone is working perfectly well. I have not had cause to regret buying it one day.
<<&&&&>>
If you need an iPhone not too expansive...buy it.
<<&&&&>>
Came with a small scratch on the back, doesn’t affect the phone so I’m okay with it. Then noticed the speaker sounds muzzled and sometimes staticky. If it gets worse I will return.
<<&&&&>>
Item like new, few minor scratches but does not affect usability
<<&&&&>>
This was for my daughter and she loves it .
<<&&&&>>
It says it is renewed and looks like a new apple iphone. Also that it is checked up by amazon professionals. It came and the back of the phone was cracked and the camera was shattered. Second time in 1 week trying to buy an iphone off amazon. Neither of them worked :)
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in better condition than expected. Virtually brand new condition. Battery life could be better...seems to be about 60-70% of what I read about the phone on Apple web sites prior to my purchase. Overall I give it a thumbs up and would recommend this seller to a would be buyer.
<<&&&&>>
It just didn’t work with Xfinity mobile so I do have to return this item unlocked does not mean fully unlocked apparently I still haven’t figured it out
<<&&&&>>
Almost like a new one, my young sister love it very much, thanks
<<&&&&>>
The phone is not unlocked. Do not waste your money
<<&&&&>>
Touch screen less sensitive and locks up a lot, don’t think I’ll waste time with refurbished Apple products again
<<&&&&>>
Perfect I have it for almost 1year and never a si for issue.. perfect condition like new.. thank you
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived on a non protected box, and the phone was not un good condition as the description says, The screen has a Lot le scratches and also dead pixels The body of the phone is very damaged it seems that has a Lot of falls before. Do not buy this phones
<<&&&&>>
Idk but it’s all Gucci
<<&&&&>>
Better than expectations
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this and I was really excited for it to come. It showed that it got delivered a day earlier on my phone but when I went home, it was not there. It also said I signed my name for it but I did not. If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Do not buy this product. This is a scam.
<<&&&&>>
I always get nervous about purchasing a product when I see bad reviews but I was happy to open my package to my new iPhone 7 Plus in perfect condition! There we no scratches, cracks or anything wrong when using the phone. Very happy about my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Yes it did meet my expectation it’s great look good as new only one problem I got was that the battery die a little too quick but it’s quickly change rge with the charger I got with it so I don’t really make it much of a big deal if you thinking about getting one you should
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in good condition just had to get a new battery
<<&&&&>>
1st. On Advertising it's saying Unlocked but I received locked phone. 2nd. The phone has big dent on top corner. I wasn't happy with this experience. Not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
fine
<<&&&&>>
Gracias
<<&&&&>>
Not as good as advertised
<<&&&&>>
Got it in perfect condition with 92% battery life.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone, great price! 👍 Was skeptical yet hopeful. Satisfaction delivered...
<<&&&&>>
Was a little worried but everything is perfect with the phone. Got the battery capacity at 90% which isn’t bad for a used phone.
<<&&&&>>
My phone was very good they even put a screen protector on it , thank you so much . I would definitely recommend other people to buy phones from this company.
<<&&&&>>
At first i was kinda scared about get a iphone from amazon but honestly it’s a really good phone, maybe was a too expensive for be iphone 7 and it wasn’t new, but it’s a good phone. 🤷🏻‍♀️
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
I just want to say you should buy this !! It’s legit I’ve had this phone for 6 months now and it works great. I’ve bought two phones from amazon and haven’t been disappointed
<<&&&&>>
Product was defective, still waiting to get my refund
<<&&&&>>
Replacement for device that wasn’t charging any more
<<&&&&>>
The screen it not working if I press a later it shows other like if I press k it shows g y b so it is not working as it should.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent
<<&&&&>>
Very good buy
<<&&&&>>
Product arrived on time and met my expectations. I’ll surely patronize them again.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in looks brand new. And functions great except anytime I get a text the alert glitch’s and sounds like an old android
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks very new ..no damage at all ...tho I still want to check the phone for another 2weeks before I’m fully satisfied ....and battery life is not just that very perfect but cool with me
<<&&&&>>
Like it still learning how to use it
<<&&&&>>
This phone is Defective you have to put this on speaker to hear worst purchase ever.
<<&&&&>>
No scratches visible BUT speaker was awful and battery was awful. Need to be fixed. But overall screen is good and system is good.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone and great seller , recommended!
<<&&&&>>
There is NOT 3d touch and the camera shutter sound and the recording sound is not able to be turned off. It is a good phone and nothing else is wrong with it.
<<&&&&>>
There is quite a lot of scratches on its back. The battery has 81% life left.
<<&&&&>>
I took it to a verizon store to add it to my account and the phone would not connect to the verizon network.
<<&&&&>>
This is my third time buying this phone.
<<&&&&>>
After my pops iPhone 6s Plus was stolen out of our car I got him this one as a replacement he loves it and couldn’t be happier with the phone.
<<&&&&>>
I had expected it to be at least somehow scratched, but EVERYTHING WAS FLAWLESS. I am honestly, absolutely speechless. Thank you so much.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was not unlocked as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
love it still works great
<<&&&&>>
Daughter loves it no issues at all.

Excelent!!
<<&&&&>>
Battery life is not good
<<&&&&>>
Sweet
<<&&&&>>
Just perfect
<<&&&&>>
All working battery ok.
<<&&&&>>
I bought it for a game. The home key is not good, and the figure point is not available. The other functions are OK. But I am so lazy to return it. I think I can use it for one year.
<<&&&&>>
Don’t buy this iPhone
<<&&&&>>
If you a Verizon, this phone will not work. Waste of time. Returning.
<<&&&&>>
Once I bought this phone it glitches and freezes. I’m sending this phone back ASP. I’m very disappointed in this.
<<&&&&>>
I feel I got a good value for the money spent. Although, this is my first iPhone and I need to learn how to use it.
<<&&&&>>
The phone failed to drop water. Very badly why iphone 7 is against water
<<&&&&>>
Good phone. I like it. I trust this company now!
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks great, came with screen protector already installed. Although genuine apple charging hardware would be nice. Only thing is, the phone I received was NOT compatible with Verizon. Luckily I'm switching networks anyway but it's still annoying
<<&&&&>>
good phone
<<&&&&>>
I love how this phone feels when I hold it - smooth, solid, and dense. The screen is great. The cameras are awesome. It does everything I want it to do. It's wonderful seeing that, what used to fill my old phone's 32 GB, now occupies only a minuscule portion of the available storage. It only has two negatives: - The sleep button is on the side, so, when I turn it off, I also change the ringer volume.. - Since it's so smooth, I worry about losing grip and dropping it when I pull it from my pocket.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this, knowing that the Jet Black basically gets scratched if you look at it too hard. Was expecting some scratches, but surprisingly, the phone was very clean, like new condition. There were some micro abrasions near the bottom edge, but it is in very good condition, from BuySPRY Phone is unlocked, I wanted Verizon service, so I ordered a Verizon sim card from TracFone and moved my existing account. So I can confirm that it works fine on TracFone using Verizon towers.
<<&&&&>>
Bought from Buyspry and it was 99% flawless , Everything was literally perfect and worth every penny , I expected something much worst cause you know " used" .. But nope ! looked brand new with a tiny tiny single scuff pffff!!! WOW. Mine came with a glass screen protector already installed with usb cable, power adapter and sim card removal tool.
<<&&&&>>
The phone looked brand new, but the set-up was near impossible because of the glitchy keyboard. Click one letter and several others surrounding it would also fire off. I had to give up setting a passcode. After managing to get to the main screen things seemed to work fine for a few hours, but then began freaking out again. I sent it back as fast as I could.
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit worried after reading all the reviews that I was going to get a piece of junk. I’m happy to report that the device received exceeded my expectations. There was not a scratch and works perfectly. I also received it a day earlier, it was shipped immediately. I am thrilled at the steep discount without sacrificing quality and functionality.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone. Does not have earphone jack built in.
<<&&&&>>
Had to return it because the speaker was broken
<<&&&&>>
Phone seems great. A few nicks on the sides but that’s expected. An added bonus was the 3 free months of phone service that was included in the box.
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks and feels new. More important is working nice. So so far so good
<<&&&&>>
excelente producto
<<&&&&>>
The fingerprint reader could be better. It does work but marginally. Battery charges up to 100%. Good value for the price.
<<&&&&>>
Love it!
<<&&&&>>
Excelente Equipo satisfacción total
<<&&&&>>
Phone is excellent. Good condition-new. Working perfectly. Thank you very much!
<<&&&&>>
An excellent phone like new. A bargain at the price.
<<&&&&>>
Good item
<<&&&&>>
I work great no issues so far.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is locked and they don't even care how unfair you feel. They don't even want to discuss anything with you to come up with a better solution.
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Currently I’m giving this 1 star- would give zero if I could. I will change my review based on responsiveness of seller and resolution of issue. Item arrived quickly and looked ok- but immediately it isn’t working properly. There’s some sort of issue effecting the screen (and everything is bouncing- see video). It’s also effecting typing things in- for example the unlock screen types in wrong numbers for password and we now are locked out of the phone. This has happened 4 times- you go to type in the first number and it inputs more than you type and then locks phone. We’ve been locked out several times now. Definitely a screen issue. UPDATE: amazon and seller weer both extremely responsive. It was backed by an amazon guarantee, but seller responded immediately and allowed us to return and we got a full refund. I elected not to have another resent- We were aware it’s a refurbished product so another *might* have been ok, but we decided against trying again at this price. Customer service was excellent though- so very happy about that and added an additional star. Can’t give more than that though since phone was useless to us and too much of a risk to try again.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this thinking it was "fully unlocked" but i went to verizon and they said its not compatible with their carrier. Thanks a lot :)
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had this phone for just over a week now and I have to say I’m very satisfied. So far it has worked great. The delivery was on time and the packaging was good. The phone was in great condition, the only thing I noticed were a few slight dings where it may a fallen with the previous owner but it’s nothing serious or too compromising (knowing it’s a pre-owned device). I purchased my screen protector and case separate but I was curious if it came with a screen protector since most of the pictures here has it on, so I just thought it may be good to know. Finally I don’t wanna make this too long but I noticed that most of the bad reviews here are due to peoples sim cards not working, and that’s easy to figure out why with just a little research. It says in the title that the device is GSM unlocked which means it only worked with AT&T, T-Mobile and some others I think, but not Sprint and Verizon. As mentioned I’m happy with the purchase and I’ll try to update this in a while to let you know the progress or if anything comes up. I hope this was helpful.
<<&&&&>>
Just got it delivered. Phone has a lot of dents but at least the screen is not cracked or anything and so far is working great👍🏻
<<&&&&>>
The condition of phone was in great shape! whats bad: Hearing and microphone doesn't work for what I've paid for the phone everything should had been working superbly. last five digits of the (IMEI & S/N 98269 -- 6HG04 ) so if you get this phone don't be surprise that it does't function properly.
<<&&&&>>
Malísimo aspecto, cargador no original y no viene con ningún accesorio, aparte ya han pasado dos semanas y no me han reembolsado el dinero
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the 7 plus as an upgrade to my 6s. I had to return it because it was not reading my carrier, even though it said “unlocked”. Acoording to the guys at Verizon, the 7 plus in particular has compatability issues when changing from one carrier to another. Every model after the 7 has a “duel antenna” making compatability easier. So, I don’t know if this is just a manufacturing issue by Apples part or a bad device from the retailers part, otherwise I’d give five stars. Delivery on time, everything else great besides this issue.
<<&&&&>>
When I got the phone and called in to activate , I was told it was an iPhone 7,no Plus! It was supposed to be an iPhone 7plus! And the box said it was an iPhone 7plus I could not setup voice mail at all even though it was unlocked for any carrier.
<<&&&&>>
Item was NOT unlocked. SCAM!! I am Returning
<<&&&&>>
Looked like new, had to update the OS which was a bit of a pain. Had to plug it into a PC with iTunes to update it but after a couple of tries it worked. Then transferred old phone info over easily. Wife loves the big screen and camera.
<<&&&&>>
4 stars because it has a couple scars. Idk if it’s just me.? Or if anyone notices that once it’s fully charged it shoots down in the 80 percentages.. &it takes forever to charge fully.. Idk if they made iPhone 7’s battery trash or because they’ve made Newer ones? But over all ilove the phones &a bigger screen. It came with a charger &a port but no headphones, worth the price &it shipped quickly.
<<&&&&>>
This was the best investment I made. The phone came on time and looked like new, I didn’t find my scratches on it and worked perfectly. It paired with my old iPhone and everything synced into it in matter in minutes. I recommend this product.
<<&&&&>>
Las bocinas no servían al 100 y se traba seguido
<<&&&&>>
did not come unlocked, not a big problem for me personally, but if you are looking for an unlocked phone I would not suggest this phone. other than that, the phone is in great condition and works perfectly!
<<&&&&>>
I could consider it as Xmas gift from the seller lol. It came extra NEW! I hope it works perfectly for years.
<<&&&&>>
The phone calls did not work. I would call someone and only hear high pick static through the top speaker. Putting the phone on loud speaker didn’t work either. If you’re looking for a phone that does everything accept what a phone was made to do in the first place, then it’s the phone for you.
<<&&&&>>
Got the product super fast and it was in perfect condition although the product said it wouldn’t come with sim ejector it had one plus a tempered glass shield and a case not a great case but a case which the seller did not have to include but did phone functions like new Have no issues with phone but will update with any further feedback would definitly buy from this seller again
<<&&&&>>
Bought this iphone for my father and it works like new havnt had one issue and he has had it for a couple of months now
<<&&&&>>
This phone got tons of screen frozen issues
<<&&&&>>
Very annoyed to see that the phone doesn't work with verizon, even though it states in the description otherwise. please don't buy this product. The apple store instructed me it only works on limited networks.
<<&&&&>>
Works as guaranteed, no flaws that I can tell. Even came with a screen protector.
<<&&&&>>
Nogood
<<&&&&>>
The phone works totally fine even outside the US! I bought it for my mom and it’s working pretty well in Brazil. Except the fact that it doesn’t come in the original box with original accessories you’d never say it’s not brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect physical condition! Works really well so far. Does take very long to charge! Could be because it’s not old! No scratches no cosmetic issues. Only have had the phone a day or two but everything seems fine! Definitely worth the price especially for an unlocked phone!
<<&&&&>>
The phone is pretty durable I’ve had it for a while and it’s still good .
<<&&&&>>
So far very good phone. Arrived early, looks like new and good battery life.
<<&&&&>>
When I bought this iPhone I thought it was gonna be bad cause I was reading the reviews but it’s bad I had the phone for a couple months and no problems at all it’s a great buy but the price Issa no it should be less than that
<<&&&&>>
El telefono ok. El cargador no es apple. No viene con audifonos.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone
<<&&&&>>
Phone is really nice, came without a scratch, camera takes pictures perfectly, but the video feature doesn’t work sometimes and I’ll have to restart the phone for it to work.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone. Been using for about 3 months. Battery life in fantastic. Phone arrived fast and looked brand new! Not a scratch or ding on it. Using on the straight talk network with no problems at all.
<<&&&&>>
Did not work at all
<<&&&&>>
This product has been amazing, nothing wrong with it except it has a little green dot on the front facing camera, which isn’t a big deal unless you take many selfies(I don’t).
<<&&&&>>
Almost brand new just a tiny scratch but that's all it came with 100% battery health
<<&&&&>>
Phone wasn’t broken when I got it but after a week of having it, the screen started to get gitchy o
<<&&&&>>
My son love it. Thank you
<<&&&&>>
I don’t use fingerprint reader. Battery life seems long. The phone Quality was very good
<<&&&&>>
Love the screen size.
<<&&&&>>
Came with 90% charged and with 100% battery health no scratches at all! Also came with a charger as well
<<&&&&>>
It works great! Not a scratch in sight! Buy a better charger but other than that, great product!
<<&&&&>>
Can I get a new charger this phone doesn’t charge with other chargers
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone
<<&&&&>>
I was worried at first but it’s great! Just buy a good case with it and take care of it👍
<<&&&&>>
Certified refurbished but was like a new phone. My wife loves it. Fully functional, Good batteries, No scratches and name it. Good product. Will buy again.
<<&&&&>>
There are screen scratches and screen doesn’t work well
<<&&&&>>
I haven’t had any problems at all since I got the phone
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new just a small stratch
<<&&&&>>
Get phone for my daughter
<<&&&&>>
The phone works pretty well but the camera is not as good as I expected

The phone had major scratches
<<&&&&>>
Still in love with this phone💜💜

Good device
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
Love, love, love. LIKE NEW.
<<&&&&>>
Writing the review from my new iPhone 7 Plus. 100% recommended.
<<&&&&>>
Very good condition and very fast with micro processes and quality in camera
<<&&&&>>
I was nervous about purchasing but I must say this phone is like new and in perfect condition!!! I received mine shipped to the Bahamas from mywitt it’s a great buy fully unlocked and 100 percent working so far so good.
<<&&&&>>
The whole promise of renewed products is around functional quality will be that of a new product. Even the product description says 'looks and works like new'. Unfortunately, that description is misleading. The product that I received had a lens crack, volume is low, and screen had a lot of dents. Otherwise the product works OK and I may buy a new iPhone XS Max as I started like the big screen phones after handling this product.
<<&&&&>>
Plugged it in and tried to turn on but nothing.
<<&&&&>>
The phone looked terrific and seemed to be ok but when u tested out the sounds the speaker made static noises. Returned phone. BTW for anyone interested in using this GSM phone on Tracfone, you must know the carrier has to be AT&T NOT Verizon or Sprint. If you want to use Verizon get a CDMA unlocked phone
<<&&&&>>
Excellent condition. Works as described with my Straight Talk wireless.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente presentación
<<&&&&>>
Just arrived today and it looks brand new. The battery seems to be working well so we are very pleased and will buy from them again.
<<&&&&>>
it's a great phone.......love it. any chance getting a samsung note 8 lol
<<&&&&>>
Deal of a lifetime
<<&&&&>>
I like to camera on this
<<&&&&>>
My refurbished phone arrived with not a single scratch on it. It works perfectly and I am very satisfied with the price I paid. If I would have bought this phone from Apple, I would have easily paid $200 more. However, I do have one issue. I ordered the Jet Black iPhone; so when my shipment arrived, the receipt, the label on the packaging, and even the box my phone came in said Jet Black but the phone that was inside was a Matte Black iPhone ☹️. I am not a picky person and I have read some of the horror stories reviews of people who have purchased refurbished phones and many things are not working properly. I’m just thankful my phone not only looks good but works properly.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone 7 is overall ok, the light intensity is not as bright as my iPhone 5 was ! It has annoying 3 axis tap I wish I could turn off when using the keypad !
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone by error because I wanted an unlocked phone. I'm unable to use the phone so I can't give any other reviews on the specs. I'm still trying to figure out a way to get the phone unlocked without it costing me too much.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was either stolen or tossed by the owner. At&t stated that the owner owes on the phone, so it can not be unlocked. The phone is useless .
<<&&&&>>
I was hesitant to purchase the phone but finally took the chance and it works amazing. It came looking brand new and was easy to switch over and set up.
<<&&&&>>
Looks and functions good im happy with this purchase
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks brand new fingerprint scanner work every time, all the buttons work good, the screen has no scratches on it. it arrived on time. All in all it’s like a brand new phone
<<&&&&>>
This is locked phone I couldn’t place other sim so I am returning
<<&&&&>>
Work ok so far
<<&&&&>>
Fairly typical for an iPhone - always not enough battery but still quite good and does everything an iPhone should do and more. The Plus models have an additional camera which allows for portrait mode - which is awesome! Great pictures. Obviously the phone is larger than the non-Plus models but I got used to that within a few days. One strange issue I had that you might have too is that the phone might be sourced from a non-American batch. Specifically, it might be sourced from Japan - a country in which local law mandates that taking a picture must always be accompanied by the shutter sound and cannot be turned off. Weird, right? I can get around it a bit by taking "live" pictures, which minimizes the sound for some reason. But any picture taken through an app like Snapchat or portrait mode will have that loud shutter sound. I considered returning the phone but ultimately decided that the annoying shutter sound was worth putting up with because buying this phone on Amazon vs Apple Store saved me roughly $350 - quite significant!
<<&&&&>>
It came a DAY early and even with a screen protector!!! The phone is perfect 👌 the phone looks like I just bought it from the apple store..
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked good about 3 months and then FaceTime stopped working. I attempted to update software and full reset on the phone and still doesn’t work. The whole reason I purchased the phone was for the FaceTime capability and now it doesn’t even work. I contacted the seller and they told me to contact the manufacturer. Apple was only able to tell me to reset the phone which didn’t work. Ultimately the phone has some type of defect and does me no good.
<<&&&&>>
The phone worked well in everything except when pairing it with a blutooth device. The audio seemed to be delayed. Initially i believed it was a software issue and would be fixed by updating it or playing with the settings, but after couple consultations with apple advisors it seemed that the issue was related to hardware, and fixing it was somewhere around 330+ $. Which is basically this phone's price. But other than the blutooth the phone is in good condition.
<<&&&&>>
10/10... there’s a lot of bad comments and maybe they really had a bad experience with the phone but guy if you want something 100 percent guaranteed go to an apple store. I’m astonished with my iPhone I think I was lucky... you may have same luck.
<<&&&&>>
Phone doesn't work, came without headphone. Tried 15 minutes, couldn't get the phone turn on.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this phone from July 2018 and still working really great
<<&&&&>>
The product is okay. I paid for 2 days shipping and it took 5 to 6 days to arrive. The home screen button is not working property. The battery drains like crazy. I already took the phone outside of country otherwise I would definitely ask for exchange or refunds.
<<&&&&>>
Bueno!!
<<&&&&>>
At first I was like oh this product will probably suck by the time I get it but the phone works great the battery life is awesome it works brand new I haven’t had any problems with it.
<<&&&&>>
👍
<<&&&&>>
Muy buena inversión fácil de usar
<<&&&&>>
Overall quality. My daughter phone.
<<&&&&>>
Lo tengo desde hace 2 meses ya y la batería sigue al 100%. Estéticamente tiene 10. El único detalle es el “vibracall”: no funciona. Pero todo lo demás está perfecto.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is even though is refurbished, it's wasn't even charge at all. There was some scratches that why I took some phone some Minor star
<<&&&&>>
Purchased this for my 14 yr old granddaughter. She is very happy with the Perforrmance and size of the phone. It is not overly large like other brands.
<<&&&&>>
Works great
<<&&&&>>
Nice,clean ,on time,working just fine
<<&&&&>>
This purchase exceeded my expectations! Hard to believe it is Refirbished. No marks or scratches what so ever. No function glitches or issues of any kind. Very pleased
<<&&&&>>
many scratches, low quality. I would prefer to pay little bit more and buy a new one
<<&&&&>>
La batería no dura nada ni 2 horas y me enviaron cargador chino súper genérico y el cable malo
<<&&&&>>
Product works fantastic, was able to put sim in and start using right away. Even arrived a day earlier than said
<<&&&&>>
Good phone only complaint is it doesn’t come with a charger.
<<&&&&>>
Great condition!
<<&&&&>>
Amazing quality item, arrived with no screen cracks whatsoever! Very happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Good products. Works just like a brand new iPhone. Only downside is the battery life.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome condition y pretty cheap
<<&&&&>>
No está liberado para cualquier compañía
<<&&&&>>
Great shape
<<&&&&>>
Me agrado el producto. Tal como lo publicado. Gracias
<<&&&&>>
Excellent
<<&&&&>>
So far so good. It looks new and it works fine.
<<&&&&>>
Todo perfecto
<<&&&&>>
Look as New.
<<&&&&>>
The phone acts up and overheats way too quickly
<<&&&&>>
Too many bad reviews I should listen
<<&&&&>>
Beside a few scratches the phone if awesome. battery is holding charge and works fine! Great deal, Im happy!
<<&&&&>>
Phone looked perfect, but every few calls it sounded like there was background wind noise. In the end I brought it to the Apple store and they told me the microphone was failing. My only option was to trade it in for $100. I wouldn't buy from this company again.
<<&&&&>>
Infact I'm returning this iPhone ,the battery came empty and couldn't turn on
<<&&&&>>
Everything great except the yellow spot on the top left of the screen but it’s only visible on white light.
<<&&&&>>
So I ordered this phone and it was advertised as unlocked. I went to verizon to activate it and they tell me it’s not unlocked and the only way to find out it’s carrier is to call every carrier until you find the correct one. So I find the correct carrier (AT&T) and buy a SIM card set it up and for some unknown reason my internet will not work without WiFi. I have data, no reason for this. It’s been a week and the problem has yet to be solved. I bought this because my previous phone completely crapped out on me. I’d send this phone back but I can’t be without a phone due to work. Still trying to figure this out but I recommend contacting the seller of any iPhone you are interested in buying before hand to receive all the information that is not advertised and to make sure their advertising is accurate.
<<&&&&>>
Delivered on time, works perfectly. Have it for over a month now and there isn’t any problems with it.
<<&&&&>>
the item advertised in the photo was Model A1660 with is Verizon compatible, the item I received was A1778 which is not Verizon compatible, I am very angry.
<<&&&&>>
Add said it was fully compatible with Verizon. NOT. Would not connect to the Verizon Wireless network. Sat on hold for 15 minutes with Breed customer service only to get hung up on.
<<&&&&>>
I was extremely skeptical, as I have always bought contracted new phones from att, but I wanted to get off their plan and I was just done with my old iPhone 5s which had completely given up on me. However, as a college student, I couldn’t afford to buy straight from Apple so I checked OfferUp and letgo, and when those seemed wayyy to sketchy I came to amazon and found this. It took me a week to finally come to terms on buying a refurbished phone off the internet, but I am so glad I did! First off, the battery life is ridiculous; I charge my phone about every TWO days. Also, unlocked made it really easy to switch to metro pcs. I love the Live Photo’s! I love the size (I have small hands, but with a pop socket, it’s perfect)! I also love being able to take it out on the boat and not worry about it getting wet! Love love love that I took the chance to buy it!
<<&&&&>>
I ordered a Rose Gold iphone 7 32GB, and it arrived via Fedex a day early. I especially appreciate that they had signature required because in the past, I have had my items stolen, with packages left on the porch. I opened up the box and it turned on with full battery, which I was not expecting. Came with a block and charging cord. There is virtually no cosmetic issues. A small area around the camera that is lighter in a spot a previous owner must have had a case. This phone is cdma, and was no problem to connect to my carrier (Total Wireless) which runs on Verizon's network. I am really pleased with this because it came exactly as expected, and actually in better condition than expected.
<<&&&&>>
The phone itself was in perfect shape and took all my transferred info from my current phone. However, the other reviews are correct when they say this phone does not work with Verizon. We tried everything thinking others might have forgotten a step or two but after verifying the serial numbers with Verizon it was confirmed that this phone wasn't going to work. It was a shame. Verizon claimed it is a common problem with the IPhone 7's.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived on time and looked good. It was fully unlocked and was successfully set up to work with Straight Talk. The phone was given to my daughter. However, right out the box, it was difficult hearing a conversation through the handset. Had to turn on the speaker. Initially thought it was just operator error. A few weeks later, my daughter calls and says she's purchasing a blue-tooth ear phones because she still couldn't hear any conversations without using the speaker. Other than that, the phone worked perfectly. I called the vendor and explained the situation. They happily sent a return label and said they'll send a refund. I'm giving the phone a 3-start rating and customer service and extra star rating.
<<&&&&>>
Bought phone to use with T-mobile. All was good for the first few days till my daughter noticed it wasn't going on internet anymore or receiving / making calls. Called T-mobile to try and fix since it was a service issue, but they exhausted their options on trying to solve problem and suggested I call Apple instead. Apple tech support also exhausted their options. They mentioned to me that according to the serial #, the phone is a part of the first bunch sent out when the phone was first made that had some kind of defect, that they will replace it with a new one on an even exchange. Sent my phone in to apple, only to have it sent back to me with the email (see photo attached) saying that since the phone has 'unauthorized modifications' they will not send me a new one. Immediately got my refund, and went to t-mobile instead to buy the same 7 for $60 more, BRAND NEW, no modifications, no troubles. The description section will sell you a dream. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
<<&&&&>>
This was a really nice phone ! Barely any blemishes, all data was cleared and battery drainage is great.
<<&&&&>>
Don’t you ever dare attempt to get this rubbish. On the advisements said:”fully unlocked”. However it doesn’t work with spring. This is a completely a conspiracy swindle. If there was negative start rating for this review. I would put as the limit of start go to -infinity. Literally wasted of costomer time.
<<&&&&>>
I specifically chose this phone because it was from amazon prime which I trusted until now and has a picture stating it is fully unlocked and would work with Verizon network! Well it doesn't!
<<&&&&>>
Battery service health was 76% in settings, which is not bad for preowned phone. But phone came in Verizon Certified preowned box and tMobile sim worked great. Phone is just like new, no screen scratches at all. Frame and back is crystal clear. i would recommend this seller highly. Updated ios to latest and worked like a charm. Best deal ever
<<&&&&>>
Where should I begin? Well, let's start off with something positive, this iPhone 7 is a solid offering (on paper) at the current price point. In theory, if the device delivered is in the condition listed on the product page, how can you go wrong for about $200? I hate to break it to you, but this can go VERY WRONG in a relatively short amount of time. I'm currently on my second renewed iPhone 7. The first one I only had for about a month and then the screen decided to separate from the metal casing of the iPhone, so I logged into my Amazon account and processed a warranty replacement. The warranty replacement showed up in two days time, no complaints there. I'm currently on my 2nd device from the original purchase and then I start getting battery life notices popping up on screen, and then a few weeks later, the center of my phone display starts to form a slight curve and gets more pronounced as the week progresses. I take my iPhone to the Genius Bar at their retail store and come to find out the battery in my iPhone has failed and is starting to bulge and expand while still in the phone. Normally I would log into my Amazon account or contact customer service and see what options are available, but of course, my warranty expired six days ago as of this review, so officially I have no warranty coverage. When I did try to contact customer service, I talked to four different reps over the course of about an hour on the phone and finally the two options provided to me to resolve this issue was...#1: "Contact Apple and see if they will honor their warranty", small problem with this is that there is only a 1 year limited warranty on iPhone's and the one year warranty started when the first owner had this phone. The phone is about two years old at this point I would assume, but definitely NOT covered under any warranty by the manufacturer. But their retail stores are more than happy to take my money and repair it. Option #2: "We can make an exception and you can send the phone back in. Even though you have a damaged battery, UPS will still take the package. We even have a warning label we can provide you that you can put on the box." Normally I would be more than happy to go with this option, however, the local UPS store has made it abundantly clear, they will not accept a package with a damaged or potentially damaged lithium ion battery due to the fire risk. The only way the phone could be safely shipped is with a fire resistant packaging which I don't have and the local UPS Store also does not have. Bottom line, I'm stuck with a phone that has a failing battery and glitchy phone display because of the swelling battery AND I'm also out of the money I paid for this iPhone, and I don't have a properly working phone. I would suggest the following, purchase a pre-owned iPhone elsewhere or just go with another phone all together, don't bother purchasing an Amazon Renewed device, the quality and reliability just isn't there.
<<&&&&>>
This phone was great. No scratches, no dents, no nothing. An amazing price for a phone not even that old! But before buying, read the reviews because Verizon isn’t compatible with it. I personally don’t use Verizon, but hey, just a heads up. This is a GREAT phone. Definitely recommend.
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone and it looked fine, including the charging cable. However, when I switched my phones with my carrier (MetroPCS which uses Verizon cell towers), I got a "No Service" message in the top left corner, where it should have said MetroPCS. Did lots of researching online, called Apple, who said it was probably a bad SIM card. Suddenly, an hour later, the phone started connecting to the cell tower. Great! I thought. It worked just fine for a few hours, and the phone showed "No service" again. I tried factory reset, connecting to Apple Store through my laptop, lots & lots of time troubleshooting. After a Google search, I discovered that iPhone 7 A1660 models had a problem antenna, which Apple was fixing for free when the phones were first manufactured (up to 3 years). I tried "chatting" online with an Apple service rep, who could not tell me if Apple would service the phone, or if I needed to return it to the Amazon seller. I finally decided to just return it. Very disappointing.
<<&&&&>>
Much to my surprise this phone came completely unlocked and in A+ condition. I moved my sim from my old phone to this one and I was up and running in 5 minutes. Like others I was skeptical about buying a refurbed phone site unseen online. Also to my surprise the phone came in a Verizon box that said refurbished along with a neatly wrapped power brick and cord. Battery life is excellent so far. Very satisfied with this purchase and for a great price.
<<&&&&>>
Iphone 7's have known antenna issues. this was the case on the iphone I received. when I got it it would intermittently work for a time...then phone service stopped working all together. the rest of the phone was fine, just no service. Had to take it into the apple shop and wait another week to get it repaired under their warranty program that was free since I provided proof I just bought it. After this repair everything was just like a new phone. no scratches, no screen problems, everything worked, battery was excellent.
<<&&&&>>
The phone that arrived was not this one, and the one that arrived is not compatible with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
It is always scary buying a used phone, especially online. The phone came faster than expected. Phone is in great condition and was very easy to set up on our tmobile network. You will need a sim card for it to work if you have T-Mobile. Great buy, my daughter is very pleased with her phone. She has had it for 2 weeks and so far, so good. Will update this post if we run into any issues!
<<&&&&>>
At first glance, the phone is in perfect condition. No scratches. Set up was easy. However, after using it for about 2 weeks, I have noticed some defects. The battery healths maximum capacity is at 86%, it should be at 100%. Siri doesn't work, it doesn't let me set it up. Wifi turns itself off sometimes and does not let you turn it on. Calls will either not go through or will sound static-y, low, like is the person was far away. I have also been told that they can't really hear me on their side. Video calls don't work sometimes like FaceTime and Facebook's Messenger's video calls. I have to turn it off and on because it decides to act up. Just today, after having it for 2 weeks, the battery started dying faster than usual. That is all I can think of right now. I will update if something else acts up.
<<&&&&>>
Never ever buy from MYWIT!! The phone did not have an imei number and was the worst piece of junk. I had purchased it for my mother as a gift and she almost cried because it would not work!! We took it to technicians to try to fix it and they all asked us where we got it. We felt like complete fools and like we had been scammed. So humiliating. MYWIT sold us a Useless junk. Not sure how the phone is with other sellers but we are in shock right now. No one can activate it and my mother's birthday is ruined. I will never shop on amazon again. This is how bad everything is. Next time I will go on apple's website. Never use MYWIT!!
<<&&&&>>
iPhone worked great for exactly 90 days. On day 91 out of nowhere in the middle of uses the screen went out. Contacted seller and they say sorry for the inconvenience but it's not covered. Mind you I had to wait 2 day to receive the phone after purchasing but they wont cover the phone warranty one day after the 90 from purchase. I do not recommend buying a renewed iphone on Amazon. Not worth the money.
<<&&&&>>
Completamente desbloqueado, lo compré para usarlo con la red de boost mobile
<<&&&&>>
This is our second attempt at a renewed phone. The first one arrived with a screen that wasn’t fully responsive and a glitchy keyboard. The second arrived with a battery health of 66%. We would have been better off shelling out the money for a new phone that works. Still waiting to hear about a refund. Update: the third phone arrived and needs to be returned. I can’t even believe the number of positive reviews. Check the battery health in settings-it’s advertised to be at 90% or above. The third one came with 85% battery health. From experience, once the battery health starts to go below 80%, it’ll need to be replaced. It’s easy enough to check so there is no excuse for selling them with anything less.
<<&&&&>>
Have had this phone for a week so far. It was fully unlocked. We connected to Metro PCS. Was in very good physical and working condition. No scratches, etc. Included a charger. My daughter loves it and has not had any problems with it. Hopefully she won't!
<<&&&&>>
Ya van varias veces k tengo k regresar los iPhone k compro y2 me an salido así o muy raspados esa luz como k no o k opinan me sorprende k dicen k expertos lo checan y voy a creer k no vean eso ósea esta bien k sean baratos pero k no manden cosas k no sirven lo use por mas tiempo pero ya no funciono la bocina
<<&&&&>>
So this phone is awesome. I bought it and was skeptical because of reviews but it is absolutely perfect. No damage. Battery life 97 left. Great phone works perfect. Connected to my network perfect. Factory reset etc. Perfect phone couldn't be happier.
<<&&&&>>
Me gusto este teléfono todo llego bien
<<&&&&>>
The speaker on my phone is screwed up. I thought it was just my internet but no. You can’t talk on speaker or FaceTime without the audio going in and out.
<<&&&&>>
I am very surprised at this product for being a ‘Refurbished’ product. It looks great! Minuscule scratch. No functionality problems at all. Battery last just over a day with use. All in all I would definitely by from this seller again.
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone one week early which was great and I was scared and nervous but I hooked it up to my MetroPCS account and it worked fine it came in a weird box, nicely packaged but the phone is great and it came with a charger. I love my iPhone 7 I received it one week early which was great It came in the mail on September 19 and today is October 7 and it’s been working great no problems at all thank you “Breed” company that I ordered from☺️
<<&&&&>>
If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. This phone arrived on time however it didn't work properly from the get go. I contacted the seller and they basically brushed me off. Wasted almost 400.00 on this garbage phone. Nobody can hear me talking to them and the volume buttons don't work. Waste of time buy new direct from Apple.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came when promised and looked like new i was able to transfer all my information on to the phone and connect to wifi- unfortunately it was not compatible with my service provided no fault of anyone. They have promised to refund me as soon as my phone was received back to them and even offer me an exchange. I purchased an phone from another source because it was a present i needed it by the weekend.
<<&&&&>>
Received it in verizon box, and it confused me. For a moment I thought maybe it doesn’t work with gsm sim. Put the sim card in and it was alright. The box itself is really light and thin, compared to geniune iphone box. Device was wrapped in bubbly plastic. No headphones. To be honest, I expected better packaging.
<<&&&&>>
Did have scratches on it but works great other than battery a little low. Update: literally 2 days After my return window closes it starts acting up! Touchscreen sensor doesn’t work on the lower half of the screen and it freezes to where i have to restart it. So bummed.
<<&&&&>>
Honestly, I was a bit skeptical buying a phone from amazon, but I had a great experience with this one. I had purchased an iPhone 7 for my younger sibling but before giving it to him I inspected it. I looks brand new and as promised, battery was at 80% battery life. My brother hasn’t have any issues since we bought it a couple months ago. Now I’m definitely purchasing another one from this vendor in a couple of days for my other brother.
<<&&&&>>
Dsde que recibí el teléfono, daba problemas para cargar al estar apagado, hasta que días después ya no se carga del todo estando apagado. Ya lo llevé a reparación y estoy esperando resultado y saber cuanto me costará arreglarlo. No lo puedo devolver pues lo traje a Costa Rica y es más complicado que tratar de repararlo.
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone but it came with a small chip on the bottom left side of the screen. Didn’t return it because it’s not that big of a deal I just put a screen protector on it and an otter box.
<<&&&&>>
Even though the phone with a little bit of scratches, the phone works perfectly. This phone DOES function with Verizon. I was very scared at first because other reviews said no it didn’t work with Verizon, but I was very happy it worked with my SIM card. The phone does not come with headphones.
<<&&&&>>
Omg why didn’t I found this device sooner?!?!? It works fine without any issues also I’m in the US and yes it works with Verizon wireless. Put the SIM card and it started working instantly.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this to replace my daughter's broken iPhone 6 and I was worried it wouldn't work on Metro PCS but we had no issues. I'll be replacing my boys phones with this one too
<<&&&&>>
Quick delivery and phone arrived as described. As the description says it’s is refurbished, but there was absolutely minimal wear. The battery is doing fine, which was one of my fears because they seem to start dying more quickly as they age. Over all, a good buy.
<<&&&&>>
great value great quality six months of use only one minor system malfunction-self corrected quality of resolution audio and software is equal to that of a new apple phone
<<&&&&>>
I'm not fond of Apple's pay-me-for-life cloud*. But, at this price it is the best performing phone. Yes, the memory is limited, but you can always move files to the myriad of free clouds. I bought two. So far, so good. Business Insider said it was a verter purchase than iphone 11. Feeling validated. *no need to subscribe to their cloud
<<&&&&>>
Love this phone. Arrived looking brand new, been a droid fan forever but would never go back. This company delivered what they promised, if I ever need another phone I would definitely buy from them!
<<&&&&>>
everything is great so far. It is unlocked, came package great too. Two problems one speaker side at the bottom of the phone is not working and the audio you get when you receive calls isn’t all that clear and loud which sucks. Still a good phone for the price I suppose could be a little less. Hoping for the best in the next few months.
<<&&&&>>
No activation issues (metro pcs) my wife loves it. There were no signs of use looked new.
<<&&&&>>
It did not work in Brazil. I could install my Apple account and validated the phone. But it did not recognized any telephone net. I went to an authorized Apple assistance in Brazil and they could not fix the problem. So I had the option to return it trough Apple replacement police, paying R$2000, or return to US dealer. As I am in Brazil, I choose to return to Apple. But I had this prejudice of R$2000!
<<&&&&>>
The phone is clean, the battery health is about 90%. The included aftermarket charger looks super cheap, but is capable of 2 Amps- as much as the phone can take.
<<&&&&>>
I took a risk ordering a iPhone 7 refurbished phone from iCertified to tell you the truth it looks brand new the screen clean it works well and I will definitely recommend this company for anyone that's interested in a refurbished phone
<<&&&&>>
To start out when the phone came the screen was popped out slightly in the top left corner. I thought no big deal it's a refurbished phone. The first week it worked great, everything functioned as it should but then around day 10 it started overheating quickly. The next few days it would die a lot faster than it had even when I put it on low power mode. After that I noticed the screen was popped out more, almost like all the overheating was making some glue or seal for the screen melt so it separated. The final straw was when it would be at about 70-50% battery then just suddenly turn off and die, when I tried turning it on it showed the screen suggesting you plug it in, so I did. Then it would turn on the second I plugged it in and show 1%, then change straight to 10%, then 20-30% and I would take it off the charger and it would die right away again. It did that for 3 days before I decided to return it. I didn't even have it a month. What a waste of money, do not recommend buying from the MyWit company.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my friend because her phone broke and I have bought refurbished phones before and I was VERY happy about this one, worked perfectly no problems thus far and I have had it for about a month now
<<&&&&>>
I like the phone has worked great so far with my carrier. I am happy with it and arrived on time and as described
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone quickly and was able to load all of my apps and pictures with no problems. I took it to Verizon thinking there was something the needed to do. All they did was put the SIM card from my old phone in my new phone. No charge! The phone works great but the battery doesn’t last long.
<<&&&&>>
There are no dislikes about the phone it came to for the time that I was supposed to get it and I’ve had no issues with the phone at all. Are used to mobile so it definitely is fully unl there are no dislikes about the phone it came to for the time that I was supposed to get it and I’ve had no issues with the phone at all. I use t-mobile so it definitely is fully unlocked. The phone I got before it gave me trouble so definitely glad I got it.
<<&&&&>>
Don't buy it, this phone have been used before, because it came with scratches and didn't came with the original charger and earphone
<<&&&&>>
Muy feliz con la compra, superó mis expectativas parece nuevo! Totalmente desbloqueado lo estoy usando en Buenos Aires - Argentina. Funciona a la perfección y estéticamente está intacto :) La entrega la realizaron unos días antes de lo pactado y no habia nadie en el domicilio, pero lo retiré sin inconvenientes en una sucursal UPS.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my daughter and she seems very pleased with it. We use Ting as our phone service and it was super simple to set up.
<<&&&&>>
I replaced my old iphone as the battery wasn't holding up too well and I needed to use maps. The phone I purchased decharges rapidly, I am talking 80% to 10% in less than 3 minutes, and the battery is listed as needs servicing in the settings screen. Considering this is meant to be fully refurbished, it clearly is a defective product. I would not recommend buying a phone from this seller.
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked fine for the first 45 days. After that there was some static in the sound and now 2.5 months later I cant hear people and vice versa. It came with very little scratches, fixed screen, and battery percentage of 76% life. It came in a regular package and they gave generic headphones and charger.
<<&&&&>>
Very very nice phone!!!! Definately recoomend. Looked exactly like how it would have looked at an apple store!!! So happy with this purchase. The bad reviews were probably just a bad one but mine was beautiful. Had no scuffs or marks at all
<<&&&&>>
I received this item yesterday and it’s defective. The screen freezes and won’t let me click on it until I lock and unlock it again. I’d love to take this review off when it is resolved
<<&&&&>>
For a 200$ dollar refurbished phone 7 I was blown away by the quality, of course it won’t look brand new straight out the box because it’s not, but it barely has any scratches or dents and the battery lasts for a long time. Only thing I didn’t really like was what came with the phone, since the parts are generic, like the charger, and does not come with headphones or an adapter.
<<&&&&>>
Fantastic! My bestfriend loved it! She uses it all the time. And even got a nice case for it.
<<&&&&>>
Thought was getting a 256gb
<<&&&&>>
First time I’ve ever bought a refurbished phone so I was scared at first. After I got it, it was clean, everything worked. The only problem is when the screen has dark colors, you can see a fault in the screen but it’s hardly noticeable will but a refurbished phone again If needed
<<&&&&>>
I needed a iPhone 7 or higher to trade in to get a new Iphone. I was changing cell phones company’s and my iPhone was to old. I was afraid of buying a phone one secondary market, (might be locked stolen broken) This phone came very fast and was perfect I looked brand new. Everything worked perfectly plus it came with guarantee!
<<&&&&>>
I waited to write a review until I've owned the phone for a while, and I am very happy with it. I have had no problems at all. I don't find the battery life to be amazing, but it holds up decently.
<<&&&&>>
I paid for two day shipping so i can have it before i traveled and it came a day after scheduled. Good phone i love it. Way better than my cracked up iphone 6 and faster.
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone there is no scratches or anything it honestly looks like i bought it brand new but it doesnt come with headphones but most paet its really good
<<&&&&>>
I hope it last. After 4 months still running strong
<<&&&&>>
Esta en perfecta condiciones
<<&&&&>>
Good condition but at this price they must change the battery and don’t give me a phone with a 80% battery health ! I honestly believed that over 200 dollars for an iPhone 7 then it meant that the battery was changed or at least 90% battery health as it remains the lost important feature on an iPhone ...
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had this phone since last year and I’ve had no problems with it. I refuse to update the software though for fear of battery life loss. Otherwise works perfectly! Full charge lasts until night, camera works perfectly, and the phone itself is fast and responsive.
<<&&&&>>
I bought one of these phones and returned it because the volume for phone calls was very low and hearing the other person was almost impossible. I tried another one and it’s Battery health was 65% and the connection with the charger was not secure so that if you moved it it would stop charging.
<<&&&&>>
The call quality is very very poor. You can hear the person on the other end fine but the person only hear you in patches. The picture quality is also very poor. This was a really poor refurbished job and wasn’t worth the price I paid for it.
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
I ordered an iPhone 7 32 GB from BuySPRY. The phone was in near mint condition, came with charger and surprisingly a tempered glass was already on the phone. The phone was also fully unlocked so it was ready to use when I received it. Great quality with Fantastic customer service.
<<&&&&>>
Bien
<<&&&&>>
Extremely impressed with the speed of delivery. Excellent condition absolutely no scratches or blemishes. The phone works flawlessly. The same quality as if you went to the apple store and got it off the shelf.
<<&&&&>>
At least it works.
<<&&&&>>
Son wanted one for his birthday. Personally not a fan of Apple products but my son loves it. Has everything he needs and his friends have the same.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone 7 five months ago and the phone started losing service and after a week would not connect to service at all. After 90 days the vendor will not do anything. Total waste of money! Would rank this product a zero if I could.
<<&&&&>>
I liked everything about this phone, it is definitely way better than I had expected. I only had it for a day but I’m hoping it lasts for another year or so!!
<<&&&&>>
Top notch hardly any damange
<<&&&&>>
This is not a Verizon compatible phone. Just got it today & it's going back!!!!! Why didn't I read the reviews.
<<&&&&>>
Easy transaction. Great purchase to replace my college students broken phone. Thank you!
<<&&&&>>
This product arrived like as new. I really appreciated it!
<<&&&&>>
So far the phone has been great exactly as advertised. great value
<<&&&&>>
A scam the phone was not unlocked. does not work with any operator is blocked by apple be careful with this seller. He gave me no solution.
<<&&&&>>
It was fully unlocked as advertised. It wasn’t compatible with the service I was using but planned on switching providers anyways. So I was totally satisfied. Had no scratches or dents and it shipped fast. I most definitely will be a Repeat customer.
<<&&&&>>
nice phone i like it
<<&&&&>>
Works with safelink wireless. Put in sim card from old phone , worked immediately!
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great! I read the reviews after I purchased and saw it might not work w Verizon and got nervous. I tried to cancel the order but it was too late. Very happy I couldn’t cancel! The phone works w Verizon and works great in general!
<<&&&&>>
I read some bad reviews and got scared to order any phone that was refurbished and i got this one , it came with the charger , phone and thats it , that fine for the price I just wished it came with headphones or at least an adapter but its okay! It worjs VERY well , have had no trouble with it AT ALL
<<&&&&>>
This phone seemed fine when I purchased it but time past by and the phone started messing up by not wanting to update, bad battery,and very glitch, now I have to purchase a new phone because this one only lasted me not even 5 months
<<&&&&>>
works good
<<&&&&>>
Phone was advertised as reconditioned/ unlocked. I had Sprint service and it would not work even after replacing the SIM card. Had to go with AT&T. Besides the small hiccup, phone is a great value and works as expected.
<<&&&&>>
Product arrived quickly and as advertised. 2 weeks out and the phone is working great. Very happy with my purchase. Minor scratches on bottom and tip of phone but case covers it. Would recommend buying from this seller
<<&&&&>>
Great product!
<<&&&&>>
Good phone sometimes it freezes and have to restart but overall it’s okay
<<&&&&>>
Nicely packaged and an easy set up! Thank you!! I saved money with your product!!
<<&&&&>>
So far, I am very happy with this phone! The battery life is double of the 6s and since it was unlocked, I just switched the SIM cards and transferred everything from one phone to the other in minutes, fantastic!
<<&&&&>>
Nice
<<&&&&>>
When I put my Verizon sim card in the phone it does not recognize the network and does not work. I have tried connecting it to my computer, restarting, restoring.
<<&&&&>>
The cell worked two months and there was no more, not if the battery is damaged or just came
<<&&&&>>
Just what we ordered and hoped for
<<&&&&>>
This phone is a scam don’t even waste your money. Not a real phone ! Called every carrier I could just to be told they can’t even find it in the system!
<<&&&&>>
great phone exactly as listed
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone
<<&&&&>>
Good condition
<<&&&&>>
This was a horrible buy. Only 3 months after buying the phone, the keyboard stopped working as well as a fingerprint and the unlock botton.
<<&&&&>>
Came without a single scratch, started right up after a charge, and after I popped my SIM card in everything worked perfectly. Battery dies a little quick but I am constantly dependent on my phone for work and personal life.
<<&&&&>>
On the description it says it is a 32GB phone but it only has 5GB. Also, when i first got the phone it said it was compatible with Sprint but it wasn't. My entire family had to switch over to t-mobile. I do not recommend buying from this company.
<<&&&&>>
This iPhone 7 was having a very poor battery life and when I get this item the screen was broken, don't buy this product.
<<&&&&>>
Funciona perfecto y luce como nuevo
<<&&&&>>
Ok
<<&&&&>>
So far so good 👍
<<&&&&>>
It definitely worth your money.
<<&&&&>>
Very bad and I did not get money back.
<<&&&&>>
Good purchase very happy
<<&&&&>>
It looks like new, I love it! I bought it for my sister in Ecuador and it really works there, she’s very happy and she loves it too!!!
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with my purchase
<<&&&&>>
equipment in excellent condition, the problem is the battery that only lasts 2 hours to discharge, I had to buy a separate charger case, the battery is 70% of useful life according to apple.
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone 7 works amazing! Appearance and battery life are great. I really have no complaints at all!
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in mint condition basically brand new I popped my sim in and it immediately was able to make calls and text I’ve read other comments saying it doesn’t work for their carrier but for t-mobile it does great price great phone
<<&&&&>>
Good decision
<<&&&&>>
Performs as expected. No complaints but have only had a few weeks.
<<&&&&>>
I bought a few of these unlocked iPhones for friends in Tanzania and it’s not allowing them to set up an iTunes username/password to download apps. It’s giving an error message. Can anyone help?
<<&&&&>>
Like new. Works with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came with 2 scratches on the screen...if it was for me, it would have gone back BUT my daughter is happy......that is all that matters....it also came 2 days early.....
<<&&&&>>
Will no longer power on I have tried two different cords and boxes and still no luck
<<&&&&>>
So far the phone work like new. It was a birthday present for my daughter. She was so happy!
<<&&&&>>
received as per order , perfect , works well
<<&&&&>>
Customer service is lacking.
<<&&&&>>
He charger that came with it doesn’t work, and no earphones came with it either. Overall the phone is nice though.
<<&&&&>>
Se escucha muy bajo
<<&&&&>>
Was Leary about buying used phone. But everything was perfect my daughter loves it.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this devise, the antenna didn't work. Sent it back for refund. That hasn't been given back!!!!
<<&&&&>>
Phone was not fully unlocked
<<&&&&>>
This phone already doesnt work. It cut off today and I just bought it for my son less than a month ago. It phone also turns off at only 20% battery mark.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve only had the phone for a couple weeks but so far so good I’m completely satisfied with the phone & it arrived earlier than expected
<<&&&&>>
The phone not working how I expected to it getting hot while charging battery life dropping its condition it ok but usage of the phone not appropriate need a refund.
<<&&&&>>
I am with no charger and was two days late
<<&&&&>>
Came in great packaging everything was perfect still am using it no issues so far
<<&&&&>>
I love it ! Thank you needed a brand new phone added a SIM card to it ❤️
<<&&&&>>
No me llego en el tiempo previsto y ya no hay quie reciba. Como hago para que entreguen y me devuelvan el valor
<<&&&&>>
This phone is amazing. I have had it for 2 days now and I love it. Nothing is wrong with it the only thing is that it does t go through Verizon
<<&&&&>>
The phone is very good, super fast although it did come with scratch’s around the sides and the battery would die within 2 or 3 hours of fully charging it
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with this purchase. It came 2 days early and looks and runs as if it were brand new. I will definitely be using these guys for all my future phones.
<<&&&&>>
The pictures are not so clear they look colorless i don't Know if the iPhone screen was changed
<<&&&&>>
Nice
<<&&&&>>
Cameras all stopped working. The front camera the first month
<<&&&&>>
Awesomr
<<&&&&>>
My daughter loves it
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Great phone at better price, wife likes it. Looks new.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone! I love it using it on tmobile and works just fine...
<<&&&&>>
It looked good, is working good it’s worth what I paid, haven’t had no problems my daughter is happy.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone from a person that knew something was wrong with this phone . I didn’t even have the phone a good two months and the cell phone completely shut down on me.
<<&&&&>>
Totally love it. In fact, it's hard to disagree that it ain't brand new. It was indeed a good bargain.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente funciona perfectamente bien no tuve ningún problema y sin ningún rasguño
<<&&&&>>
The phone only worked for 2 weeks. The speaker and microphone completely went out and cost more to get fixed than the phone. Don’t buy this phone it’s best to buy out of the store
<<&&&&>>
This phone works perfectly and the battery lasts all day.
<<&&&&>>
Not compatible with Verizon even though they clearly state that phone can be used with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
It was perfect! Thanks
<<&&&&>>
Como nuevo lo considero razonable el precio vino en condiciones excelentes lo recomiendo
<<&&&&>>
Got this for my daughter. TMobile connected right away and no problems at all.
<<&&&&>>
Worked fine at first was able to put in SIM card but this phone has a bug constantly no service after restarting multiple times, the issue kept going. Needed to return it.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone! It’s fast, also has a fantastic camera.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t get my phone
<<&&&&>>
So far the phone works great. All features are working amazing. It even worked with my cellphone carrier (cricket). There was not a single scratch or dent on the phone which was 100% worth the money I paid.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente 5 estrellas
<<&&&&>>
ok
<<&&&&>>
It doesn’t have proper charger and it doesn’t come with headphones. I kept this mobile on desk i observed that mobile is not flat it’s bended
<<&&&&>>
Minor signs of wear like description said. Overall it is worth the price. Definitely recommended. Had it for approximately a month and it runs smooth
<<&&&&>>
I got a refurbished phone but its just as good as a new one. Nothing is wrong.
<<&&&&>>
él teléfono salio bien en la mayoría de las pruebas pero él bluetooth tiene problemas, lo uso en Venezuela es muy complicado devolverlo
<<&&&&>>
I love it!!!!!!!!!! Minor statches, no problem at all
<<&&&&>>
El microfono del iphone no funciona tendre que devolver el iphone yo de verda lo necesitaba para esta semana nadie prueba que los iphone funcionen correctamente antes de enviarlos
<<&&&&>>
It was like new, just like the one that had been stolen from me. And it arrived so quickly. I’m very pleased.
<<&&&&>>
the iphone was in very good conditions
<<&&&&>>
Excellent conditions ! Couldn’t recognize a new from a used one !
<<&&&&>>
Gave it to my sister as a gift she says it works so I guess it does😂
<<&&&&>>
The battery life is absolutely terrible. This is my first iPhone so I’m not sure if they all suck but yeah I have to charge it at least 3 times a day.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was exactly as described. The battery life is phenomenal. Charges just fine. No problems whatsoever two weeks in
<<&&&&>>
Bien
<<&&&&>>
Overall great phone, great condition. Shipping was fast and smooth. Obviously battery life is not as it was when it was brand new but that comes with usage over time.
<<&&&&>>
Dislike
<<&&&&>>
Can’t go wrong with a iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Product top. Excelent condition.
<<&&&&>>
Phone kept giving a password that was no good. I don't think this phone was unlocked correctly before sale. Won't be a repeat customer.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was presented well,but was unable to use device as it was a Verizion phone and not unlocked for all carries as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
So far this phone is awesome! Great price for right now and arrived with no flaws at all. It does come with a weird charger (not apple) but it gets the job done. Very happy so far, if anything changes I will update this post.
<<&&&&>>
Good cell for 204
<<&&&&>>
This phone is advertised as fully unlocked.... beware it is not! took the phone to Verizon and it does not work with Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
Came in sooner then expected! Unlocked just as described, my cricket wireless sims card worked in it with no problems!
<<&&&&>>
Wish the battery life was a little better but overall very happy with purchase.
<<&&&&>>
The presentation could of been better and also i was it came with headphones but overall worth buying
<<&&&&>>
No funciona el botón de inicio , el cargador no es original
<<&&&&>>
Product received just as described
<<&&&&>>
I’m so upset for not getting properly working iPhone and the seller should have to test appropriately before selling any item
<<&&&&>>
perfect state of conservation, everything running hard enough battery. I'm glad everything is according to the announcement.
<<&&&&>>
My daughter loved her iPhone no issues. Everything working just fine
<<&&&&>>
This phone was not unlocked.... It’s a T-Mobile only phone

<<&&&&>>
Did not work with verizon! Very disappointed. Sending back!
<<&&&&>>
Great price
<<&&&&>>
DO NOT BUY!!! this phone is not compatible with Verizon. It is also not fully unlocked. This phone has restrictions from the previous owner which did allow me to activate my phone. This phone is was in great shape on the outside but horrible and problematic on the inside. I cannot stress enough to not buy this product. You are better off to buy directly from apple or a trusted company.
<<&&&&>>
Everything ok
<<&&&&>>
Great condition
<<&&&&>>
Very good !
<<&&&&>>
Is not unlocked. The phone was in new condition, there isn't even scuff marks near the charging port. Shame it wasn't unlocked as advertised, wasted time.
<<&&&&>>
Fast service! Great product.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is good. It works, functional, and my expectations were met but the only thing it didn’t come with head phones
<<&&&&>>
Should have Read the Other Reviews - Verizon is NOT SUPPORTED. Took about half a day of swapping SIM cards and going to Verizon Wireless to find out the phone is a GSM only phone and would never work on the Verizon CDMA network. We ordered it almost 3 weeks ago and the website is still inaccurate and claims this phone will work on Verizon. We have asked the vendor for a prepaid return shipping label as the default is for the customer to pay for any returns. Certainly feel they should at least pay for the return after all this time working under the assumption the product description was accurate.
<<&&&&>>
Huge waste of my time! I just got back from Verizon store after having trouble with it and they said incompatible with the network, description is false.
<<&&&&>>
It was not what I spected, first the charger did not work.
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy this iphone. IT IS ONLY GSM COMPATIBLE. Improperly advertised, so now I have to wait 5 business days for my 400 dollars back! Very disappointed in both companies involved.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent experience. The phone looked completely new when delivered. No signs of wear at al.l
<<&&&&>>
I don’t like the size I like the biggest size
<<&&&&>>
Fake 100% the makwe made it look like the real iPhone. So upset..
<<&&&&>>
I have always been an avid Apple fan and recommended it to all friends and family. I have an iPhone 7 and recently it has been saying "No Service" or "Searching" where the LTE signal usually is. It didn't bother me at first because I am not on my phone all day. However, I started receiving text messages that were sent over 3 weeks ago. My calls constantly fail or just don't work at all. I will be in the middle of using my GPS to get somewhere and it will just quit working. I originally thought this was a Verizon problem so I took it to them. Turns out, my iPhone 7 has this happen regularly with many customers so I was instructed to take it to the Apple Store. I did this and they basically told me that they couldn't do anything until it gets worse because it doesn't "qualify for the program" to replace it yet. I run a business and need a reliable phone that can consistently get text messages and calls. This has already hurt my business because clients think I am ignoring them. Apple refuses to fix it. Do not purchase this phone or any Apple phone for that matter because I am sure the news ones will start to have the same issues. I almost bought an Apple Watch and I am glad I didn't because I will be switching all of my products to Droid now.
<<&&&&>>
the screen came broken
<<&&&&>>
Within 4 months my daughter's phone was dead and not fixable. This company's warranty is 3 months--that tells you enough about their belief in this product. You should not be able to buy a product at this price with such a flimsy guarantee. Remember, you may be throwing your money away. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.
<<&&&&>>
Si
<<&&&&>>
Hola yo compré un tlf. Con ustedes pero lo cancelé me gustaría saber en cuánto tiempo demora la devolución del dinero
<<&&&&>>
Phone microphone was damaged. Other party just heard static noise, had to return it. Basic testing isn’t even done.
<<&&&&>>
The product can not be connected to BoostMobile!
<<&&&&>>
👌
<<&&&&>>
I am thinking of purchasing this tomorrow. Would I just have to take out my Verizon SIM card from the phone I have now? And place it into this one?
<<&&&&>>
Is NOT UNLOCKED FOR VERIZON . PHONE WAS IN GREAT CONDITION. JUST NOT FULLY UNLOCKED . GOT IT TODAY AND SENT BACK TODay for my REFUND
<<&&&&>>
I purchased 2 iPhone 7’s and they both are in like new condition, everything on them works as advertised. There was not a single scratch on them. I checked the battery health on both and the Rose Gold was at 89% but the Matte Black was at 100%! It came with a 3rd party box, USB block and generic cable. This is a great deal!
<<&&&&>>
Resulta que compre el teléfono para regalárselo a mi hija de Navidad . Cuando llegue al país donde reside mi hija y le fui a poner el chip me dijeron que el teléfono está BLOQUEADO. ( en el anuncuio de este vendedor dice desbloqueado) y cuando voy para que me lo desbloquee un profesional me dice que me ESTAFARON porque este teléfono está bloqueado por la operadora(péguese ser que tenga deuda pendiente) y la respuesta de este vendedor es que ya pasaron 90 días TENGAN MUCHO CUIDADO CON ESTE VENDEDOR QUIZÁS NO DURE MUCHO EN AMAZON. Lamentablemente y responsablemente les digo que para mi cuando algo no coincide con lo descrito y de las caracteristicas que he relatado me siento ESTAFADO POR ESTE VENDEDOR Y SIN UNA RESPUESTA DECENTE . Es una lástima que me haya pasado a mi pero lo digo para que no le pase a ud quien me lo iba a desbloquear me dijo que seguramente es de esos teléfonos que compran a operadores con planes y después NO PAGAN el plan y por eso la operadora no lo va a desbloquear. Parece INCREÍBLE QUE ESTE TIPO DE SITUACIONESTIDAVIA PASEN Y AMAZON ME RESPINDIO QUE COMO PASO MAS DE UN MESELLOS TAMPOCO SE HACEN RESPONSABLES. Mucho cuidado tengas todos no quiero ser alarmistas pero si realista ...imagínense hoy 4 de diciembre tengo que ver cómo resolver el regalo de navidad de mi hija... Que tengan feliz 2020 y que cesen los vendedores irresponsables en Amazon!!!!
<<&&&&>>
Had to ask for exchange because the first they sent didn’t work with verizon. The one they sent as replacement had a really nice screen, with not visible scratches. The back of the phone, however, had a discoloration around the area of the camera; the part that case would leave open. The ring around the camera also had three minor, but visible, dents, but that’s pretty much all aesthetic complaints. Internally, it works well, except that there is the mental barrier where I keep thinking someone else used this phone. That said, they have a very wonderful customer service that they even provide their phone number for quick fixes over the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Outer condition is very good, we have a good case on it with a screen protector. Screen protector cracked and the screen underneath was fine. A couple hours later the screen stopped working. Paid to have the screen replaced and it is now fine. The thing I find with the rebuilds is they aren't as robust as the new units. Some are better than others. It wasn't the end of the world, screen replacement is common. Just don't expect new performance of longevity. I bought a replacement for a rebuild, it ended up having a factory known issue. Apple said they would fix it until they looked and found non apple components in the phone. Then it was buying a rebuild from them at close to new prices.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone from Kanga Supply back in July. Turns out, they source their phones internationally. Mine was manufactured in HK. Some iphones manufactured internationally have different glitches, and Apple will only take care of those problems in the country it was manufactured in. So 3.5 months (just outside the 90 day warranty!!!!) after spending $215 on this phone, it stops functioning. There is a glitch on the logic board that makes it not possible to get service, no matter your carrier settings. I contacted the seller about the issue and of course they referred me to their strict “90 day warranty” and there is no possibility for return or exchange. DON’T DO IT!!!
<<&&&&>>
Initially, after inserting my SIM card, the phone would shut itself off intermittently pretty frequently. I called Amazon (finally getting through on my old phone) for basic troubleshooting. No avail. But I made an appointment at the Apple bar and got the phone rebooted and haven’t had a problem since. Decent value if you don’t mind a possible chore. 💎
<<&&&&>>
Changed the sim card from my 6S to my 7 and have not looked back. The seven has a long lasting battery that I only charge when its percentage is at 10 and that takes 2 days in my world. The 7 works better than the lower number of iPhones due to better electronics (Thanks Apple). The 7 is just a better phone than the lower number iPhone as the Techs at ATT told me over a year ago.
<<&&&&>>
If I see, from what you say its quality control is garbage. A restored device should work 100%. You use a cheap policy for the customer. Everything he wrote spacing was the most subtle way to sell garbage. I explained the costs of connecting your device badly arranged and you grabbed it. I will buy another flagpole that arrives one that works 100% total shipping costs will be yours. I don't want to have to inform the world that your product is defective
<<&&&&>>
You couldn’t replace my Amazon gift card for me so I could actually not get this phone to my husband who’s working on an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico so you will definitely never get my business anymore either
<<&&&&>>
THIS IS A SCAM REFURBISHING RECALLED PRODUCT!!!! APPLE CAN NOT FIX THESE PHONES. This phone is a recall. It should not be being sold. Brought phone into Apple store and they told me this phone can not be fixed because it is a recall that they refurbished and been resold. Phone stopped working just outside return window. Numerous internal errors.
<<&&&&>>
IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM IS THIS PHONE COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON!!!!
<<&&&&>>
The phone we received looked like new, and has been behaving great for the last few months. Another win in the refurb lottery!
<<&&&&>>
This phone is perfect for my teenager. The battery life is good and so far (she's had it for over a month) everything is working as it should. Thank you!
<<&&&&>>
Phone is brand new. I put a SIM card in and Verizon came up with signal. My daughter is gonna love it for her birthday. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Arrived in new condition. Works great. Definitely recommend!
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone just wish it had an actual headphone jack
<<&&&&>>
Good price & I needed it fast.
<<&&&&>>
The item I ordered lasted about 4 days then it couldn't charge. Waiting to hear from the seller. We'll see.
<<&&&&>>
Worked perfectly fine on metropcs, mine was a Verizon refurb
<<&&&&>>
Received as described, looks like new, great price.
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
Got this as a gift for my mother. Works perfect , no problems
<<&&&&>>
This product is very nice and I would recommend it to anyone interested in making a purchase for a refurbished iPhone 7.
<<&&&&>>
We are very happy with the phone. Works great and functions as it should
<<&&&&>>
Thanks Wife loved it
<<&&&&>>
Item arrived not unlocked like stated. 2 weeks in, maybe getting a refund.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in great condition and works with my chosen carrier. Nobody knows it was a used phone.
<<&&&&>>
Nice and perfect phone
<<&&&&>>
Awesome
<<&&&&>>
Nephew very happy with it
<<&&&&>>
Arrived a day early and looks brand new. So far no issues but have only had a few days. Works with T-mobile
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition! Like NEW!
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in great shape but DIDNT WORK WITH MY CARRIER, despite what the ad said.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived looking brand new. I was very surprised, and happy!
<<&&&&>>
Great phone.
<<&&&&>>
Very good quality
<<&&&&>>
the battery was not the best
<<&&&&>>
Todo muy bien, el cel impecable estado. Muy amables y rápidos
<<&&&&>>
good
<<&&&&>>
Pésimo estaba dañado la tarjeta base
<<&&&&>>
Love everything about my Iphone 6S, works amazing no scratches brand new n box with charger. If i were to buy another or refer someone I would recommend this buyer and product. SUPER FAST delivery also
<<&&&&>>
I wish I could give a good review. Unfortunately this phone is labeled UNLOCKED. Apparently this is NOT. Sorry don't think I'll buy again
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this phonw for my husband who has been wanting to try Apple. Had no problems with putting the sim in and getting it started. But hes only had it a few weeks and it dies so fast! And when it gets down to 15% it will just turn itself off. You can turn it back on and it'll say it still has 10% now and will work for sometime but continue to cut itself off whenever it feels like it. The finger print scanner also works when it wants to. His phone has both of our finger prints and sometimes wont accept any of them. No problems with the screem as of yet. The battery is our biggest problem.
<<&&&&>>
Phone works fine but I bought gold and received silver and the camera shutter sound doesn't turn off even with the ringer on silent.
<<&&&&>>
Battery life came at 73% and in the description it says they only sell phones at over 80% battery life. The battery sucks and keeps dying at 60%. I just got this phone a few days ago and I will be returning it.
<<&&&&>>
The I love you more said it was like new, that was a lie. Signs of heavy use and only time will tell if there is any life left in it.
<<&&&&>>
Rec’d the phone timely. Charged it & set it up. The first day the phone shut off 7 times! Charged it again & it shut off 3 more times that evening. Had the battery tested & it’s only 53% of its capability. They may “fix” these phones so the look good, but they don’t replace the battery. In order to replace the battery, you have to go to Apple store they will order battery, takes 2 weeks & $29, then you have to go back to have it installed! Not a good purchase!
<<&&&&>>
This iPhone 6s is exactly as described! It works perfectly and is aesthetically flawless! It doesn’t have any visible wear and tear. I am so excited to gift this to my daughter for Christmas!
<<&&&&>>
Lo voy a regresar porque la bateria no sirve y quiero que me lo cambien
<<&&&&>>
Phone is junk. Can't stay charged long, keeps losing service. Many problems with it!
<<&&&&>>
Beautiful my granddaughter loved it! Everything works well on it no problems
<<&&&&>>
No está liberado, SIM invalida, estoy decepcionado con esta compra.
<<&&&&>>
I love everything about my iPhone 6s, I’m so happy. Couldn’t have chosen another seller to purchase from other than BuySPRY will definitely be purchasing from you guys again. Best birthday present. Thank you all so much.
<<&&&&>>
Had server issues couldn’t even activate it
<<&&&&>>
Phone was used to replace an older android phone. Started up with no problems and has worked perfect. Would buy one again.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone
<<&&&&>>
I really liked the quality of the product as in functioning, but the battery life is so awful. Like I’d be using it for maybe 20 mins and it goes from 100% to 75%.
<<&&&&>>
This phone works amazingly and there are no visable scratches or dent. Comes like if it's brand new.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is in great condition, texted the battery leaving the phone on standby for three days with a fully charged battery and after 3 days only 6% of the 100 was used. So far a great product. KD. NJ.
<<&&&&>>
The translation was quick. The phone Looks like brand new and is in a great condition!
<<&&&&>>
The phone have someone iCloud n the phone seems very older and seem card place is not in there
<<&&&&>>
Battery goes low very fast. Other than that it was in good physical shape
<<&&&&>>
Horrible... Phone came dead and didn’t want to charge over 10%.Very Disappointing!!
<<&&&&>>
I realized it didn't come with an adapter or headphones.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was practically new.....
<<&&&&>>
It doesn’t even work properly
<<&&&&>>
Love it
<<&&&&>>
I love everything except that when ever I call the mic gets low so I can barely hear I would have to put it on speaker to hear
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in great shape no scratches and it's in perfect working order. Thank you will definitely order from you again!
<<&&&&>>
fast shipping ! works great
<<&&&&>>
Like New...
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
Great phone for my 10 year old daughter she is a phone addict😂 she has really been wanting a phone so I thought this would be the perfect one for her came in great condition and an amazing phone
<<&&&&>>
Originally I wrote a bad review because the cell phone had an issue with the lcd screen. Well the supplier sent me another one for free and even told me to keep the other one because I had it fixed. So I actually got two. Awesome customer service.
<<&&&&>>
Small dent on the top , but apart from that it’s looks new Not an Apple charger No headset No original box
<<&&&&>>
On time deliver an as describe
<<&&&&>>
Works great so far
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new and it has a long battery life. Great price also.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in good cosmetic condition however the battery life was horrible had to send it back the same day I received it. The phone was losing charge ridiculously fast.
<<&&&&>>
New as advertised. No scratches or dents.
<<&&&&>>
It was a positive experience overall. The product was delivered on time as promised, and the quality was as described by the seller. The iPhone-7 works very well so far after experiencing some overheating moments in the beginning. Everything seems to work fine after I updated the device. I was not happy with the fact that the charger and the cord were not originally from apple, but they work fine so far. I would definitely buy from them again.
<<&&&&>>
Thank you for a great price to be able to upgrade from an iPhone 5. Everything worked well and the company for the contract was able to set it up really good
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my son and as of today the phone is not charging and the reception on it is horrible
<<&&&&>>
the phone was not unlocked as described.
<<&&&&>>
Okay phone for the price
<<&&&&>>
👍
<<&&&&>>
It arrived as described.
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great! No flaws.
<<&&&&>>
Battery life is low dislike
<<&&&&>>
Fast delivery
<<&&&&>>
No llego el producto
<<&&&&>>
Phone was not unlocked. Useless
<<&&&&>>
Muy bueno
<<&&&&>>
So far so good
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone certified refurbished through amazon from MyWit. The phone came working just like brand new and even included an authentic apple charger (most refurbishing companies give an off brand charger). I bought this after receiving a very disappointing and dysfunctional pre-owned iPhone 6 from bestbuy.com. That phone was quickly returned for malfunctioning and this was a very good replacement buy. Great phone.
<<&&&&>>
Item doesn't work every 6 minutes the phone reboot
<<&&&&>>
It was refurbished but space and home touch is not working. It was not good experience to buy a refurbished iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
This is my 5th refurbished phone purchased on Amazon. I have had problems with text messages being “blocked”. ONLY on the iPhone 7. I’ve worked with my carrier trying to reset everything and have come to the conclusion that somehow the ORIGINAL carrier is linked.
<<&&&&>>
the back of the phone and corners are in deep scratches don’t know how it may be called as “renewed” phone . totally disappointed and screen looks like replaced not original .
<<&&&&>>
Works good
<<&&&&>>
thanks. very good.
<<&&&&>>
The actual iPhone SE is an amazing phone with near iPhone 6s specs, this review is more for the reseller and Amazon’s “refurbished” status. I got my order fulfilled by Bluetek Intl and it was listed as “refurbished” I’m not sure of their exact refurbishment process, but it looks like they take the phone as-is and just remove the SIM card and not actually do anything like attempt to clean it. The phone itself appears to be functional and unlocked as advertised. The phone’s screen has mostly minor scratches and one somewhat noticeable scratch...kind of expected for being refurbished. The case however has several scratches, small dents and scratches...most could overlook the condition, but it’s prettt close to sub-par. The biggest issue I had with the shipment was that the phone was physically dirty (maybe fecal matter) and I had to thoroughly clean the device before I felt it was safe to be handled....easily something that should have been done by the reseller. The other issue is that it looks like the screen was removed or replaced and improperly installed, resulting in the phone being 1mm thicker at the top vs the bottom, may be a non issue but most cases won’t fit now and there is a potential fire hazard since the battery may have been improperly tampered with.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone which states it is Factory Unlocked and can be used on any GSM provider infeenationally. Tried to use it on the international GSM carrier ORANGE but it said SIM not valid. I am overseas and will not be able to return the phone so I had to pay someone to unlock the phone. The quality of the phone is great but having to pay additional to unlock the phone is not.
<<&&&&>>
Love, Love my new phone ( new to me). I was a little concerned about it being a good phone. But I charged it and went into the AT&T store and added it to the account and was good to go
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition out of the box. No problems works like new, appears new, no scratches or blemishes. Operation and functions perfect. Fingerprint reader perfect, battery life like new. I could not find any issues with this Iphone SE 32 GB. I recommend this seller. They sold a superior iPhone SE in "New Condition", for a great price. Arrived on time using Amazon Prime.
<<&&&&>>
Looks like it was thrown into a porta-John, rinsed off with dirty water and dropped into a “Mint Mobile” box. Seriously? “Renewed?” Knockoff Screen is installed poorly and is scratched to hell, top half backlight doesn’t even work. Power button and mute switch are jammed up and don’t work. Ports and speaker grill smeared with what I can only identify as “uh uh nope not touching that”. Took a gamble on a “renewed” device as I couldn’t find a “new” iPhone SE from my carrier. Can’t even request a replacement, seller will only do a refund. Won’t make this mistake again.
<<&&&&>>
It is absolutely perfect and everything I was looking for. Before this, I had a 16gig 6S and was talked into upgrading to an 8 at the Verizon store. I honestly didn’t like the 8, and the fact that it doesn’t have a headphone jack (which is completely stupid). So I turned in the 8 and got this cute little phone and it’s exactly like the 6S but with more storage because I got 32gigs. For 170 bucks... this was a great deal. The only thing is that you need to purchase a SIM card for this phone, but it’s only about ten dollars for that.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone 6 weeks ago and am very happy with it. It's running iOS 12. The battery lasts all day if I'm actively using it and three days if it's mostly on standby. Looks brand new. I will buy from this seller again.
<<&&&&>>
I just received my iphone SE yesterday and the usage is inconsistent. My T Mobile sim card works and I am getting service however the phone's map feature isn't working and my service itself is very inconsistent....I'm hoping the company can provide some feedback/help or I will have to return.
<<&&&&>>
Husband loves his new phone. It even works via his hearing aids. He seems to be playing with it a lot. Great upgrade from his iPhone 5.
<<&&&&>>
It works just great and purchased at a reasonable price. Even though it's refurbished it looks brand new. Nice packaging and It came with a charger and a 3 foot cord. I'm so glad I made this purchase. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
It was pretty cheap so I thought why not. I use it when I go out and don’t want to lug around my big phone. I keep social media off of it so I use it as a “minimalist phone” (ha) when I don’t want to be distracted or need to pay more attention to my girlfriend.
<<&&&&>>
Battery life on the phone has been very poor from day 1. Maximum capacity is indicated at 78%, a level at which Apple recommends replacing the battery. In addition, the phone will unexpectantly shut off or restart with 30%+ battery life remaining, and then has <10% remaining upon restarting.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in flawless condition. Looked as if nobody had ever layed a finger on it. I cannot speak to the usability, battery life, or preformance of the phone as I sold it as soon as I received it but it arrived on time, looked amazing and charged right up and turned on.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was received in good condition. Good Device if you want to try out Apple or get back in the Apple OS.
<<&&&&>>
The phone works amazing and I was shocked because it looked perfectly new. Not a single scratch. My only complaint is that the battery doesn’t last all day unless you have battery saving mode on. Other than that the phone is flawless.
<<&&&&>>
At first I thought buying thing good a phone for such a small price was too good to be true .. but once I bought it I was pleased to find out it looked brand new
<<&&&&>>
Just as the picture my sister had no problem with it great phone se loved it
<<&&&&>>
Pretty good product. Everything working really fast and properly. Thanks a lot.
<<&&&&>>
Wanted to wait a few months to see how everything would turn out. It came just as described and it's still in perfect condition. No cracks, no marks. It looks new. Very happy with the purchase. I got one of the good ones.
<<&&&&>>
It was in good shape, just the back had a scratch on the apple. Works great, battery life is good . Came with a black charger( not the original) . But overall great for its value.
<<&&&&>>
This iPhone was great until recently. It wont charge, I have no idea if is a battery or charging port. So it only lasted 5 months.
<<&&&&>>
This product was not registered in the USA so it could not be used with our Verizon phone plan. We were able to return it but that just ate up a few more days of no phone service. Ended up buying a brand new phone through Verizon for $240 which was a better deal.
<<&&&&>>
Stop working after 1 year of using it. Keep turning on & off.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this as a present for my daughter for Christmas and it came faster than anticipated, was in brand new condition, and it work great at a great price.
<<&&&&>>
Wasn’t what I wanted
<<&&&&>>
I was very happy with the phone, the packaging and delivery to convenient Amazon Locker. Great experience!
<<&&&&>>
Pequeñas inperfecciones
<<&&&&>>
Great deal, even got a mint sim to use with the phone for 3 months. Really can’t complain
<<&&&&>>
Died on first day
<<&&&&>>
but, the charger is not the Apple's. No ear pods.
<<&&&&>>
almost new! a gift sent to a 12 yr old nephew who is in Asia. He was happy. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
Battery won’t keep a charge for more then 10 minutes!!
<<&&&&>>
This phone was not unlocked. Very disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
Phone works and looks brand new only minor problem was the charger and cable that came with it did not work and it made me think it was the phone that didnt
<<&&&&>>
The phone works as usual but the only reason why I'm taking off a star is due to the poor connectivity to internet. Otherwise the phone works well and the shipping process was outstanding
<<&&&&>>
Liked it
<<&&&&>>
Without scratch
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Everything’s perfect
<<&&&&>>
Works just fine. Idk what everyone else is complaining about!
<<&&&&>>
I phone 7 is not good not good at all
<<&&&&>>
I really do like it !
<<&&&&>>
I’ve waited a couple months to create a review. For under $150, what a deal! Love the small size SE and it appears to be working well overall. Took a risk on refurbished, but glad I did. The only thing I should’ve paid more attention to was my nephew’s derision upon opening the box because he saw the power cord supplied was not an official iPhone cord. It was pretty easy to tell it had been cobbled together. And it did not work with one of the wraparound cases that we used because it was too short. I was going to heat his words and either ask for replacement or go buy a new cord, but I was too lazy and it seem to work most of the time so… Imagine my sadness today when it literally broke off in the phone. A little power connector just stayed in the phone when I pulled the cord out after trying to figure out why it was not charging. Photo attached for all of your information and I did contact the seller so we will see if we get an update to this region. What was the phone worth it? Absolutely! I’m not one of those it’s gonna run out and spend $1000 on the newest model and I actually really prefer the small size. The battery life seems a little bit compromised from the original I had and was replacing, but overall, for the money, even with the crazy power cord, not too darn bad. If I weren’t posting this at the same time at the power cord had broken I’m sure I would’ve given at 4 1/2 stars.
<<&&&&>>
Looks great works way better than my iPhone 4 for obvious reasons, that being it's new, however i've discovered that the speaker used for phone calls sounds extremely quiet and it may have been a technical issue that made this phone a "refurbished phone" in the first place, i'm not sure what the standards are and for the record the bottom speakers work fine, but now i'm taking phone calls on speaker phone consistently, so that's something. Overall happy with the product, just, now everybody gets to listen to me have a conversation. Hah. Glad to have a faster phone anyhow.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had mine for a couple months with no issue! Works perfectly. However, I would advise you check which seller the phone will come from. You can see this right above the “Buy Now With 1 Click” button. It says sold by ______. Check that the seller has good reviews, because they seem to vary significantly. Since the reviews here are so mixed, it’s a good way to make sure you aren’t getting a dud.
<<&&&&>>
Defective junk. Sold item with huge water damage black cloud across screen. Test before yiou sell. Stop chearting customers! This was supposed to be a gift. Amazon-please revoke seller rights for ashipping out junk.
<<&&&&>>
Bought for my wife. We hate the upgrade/financing process at ATT now. its Bravo Sierra. I usually buy refurbed phones. I have an SE through work that is a great phone. All our cases are for this size phone, so that makes this even better...
<<&&&&>>
6 dings on the back and edges, flat wake button, but perfect screen and function so far. Fast FedEx thx! ZGear case and tempered protection widely available. Runs ios 12.2 😇.
<<&&&&>>
After reading nasty reviews I was skeptical but ended up so surprised when a basically new iPhone was sent to me! Amazing condition like it was never even touched and works like a gem! Smaller than I anticipated but overall 10/10 missing the headphones but I honestly did not care for them anyways
<<&&&&>>
Fits needs perfectly
<<&&&&>>
The only thing that caught my attention was the screen size but after using the phone it doesn’t bother me anymore
<<&&&&>>
De la nada empezó a fallar hasta el punto de prenderse y apagarse sin parar
<<&&&&>>
worst smartphone I’ve ever owned.
<<&&&&>>
At first I had nice things too say about this phone but have after 3-5 days of use... not anymore. After some days of use I’ve noticed it started too randomly reboot on me when I would be doing the most random things such as switching from my Pandora app too my Snapchat app. Also not only does it reboot on me randomly but it does a reboot loop and it can go on anywhere from 5 mins - 30 minutes. I’ve tried several things after googling this issue too try and fix it myself and no good results, even giving it a factory reset/restore from iTunes app on my laptop didn’t work.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was defective. It would work as normal and then suddenly begin restarting itself. My LTE constantly went in and out and phone said no service. Switched to Verizon thinking maybe it was MetroPCS. Nope. The phone is messed up it isnt even really usable. Very frustrating....
<<&&&&>>
Works perfectly. Great conditions. It wasn't in the original package and didn't bring the earphones, but other than that, great deal!
<<&&&&>>
The Iphone has problems with the audio
<<&&&&>>
Awesome product! Really saved a great sum of money! Does not come with headphones but the price is an absolute steal! The overall condition is like a new iPhone!
<<&&&&>>
Everything is almost ok with that iphone. Battery charger should be original apple product. There is no earphones. I received it a day earlier, good.
<<&&&&>>
In one of the phones the front camera doesn’t work
<<&&&&>>
I loved my new phone ! The service was fast and the phone was exactly how it was shown
<<&&&&>>
This phone is exactly what I wanted and in the color I wanted. It has all of the amazing iPhone features that I have come to expect from iPhone. When I purchased it refurbished, I worried that it may come looking scratched and dented but was pleasantly surprised when it looked “brand new”.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente artículo gracias
<<&&&&>>
La foto del artículo aunque diga iphone 8, no es la verdaderay si confunde. Ya que dice edición especial y sale con doble cámara más flash. Cuando solo tiene 1 camara.
<<&&&&>>
Im an I phone frantic
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in excellent shape looked brand new no ear buds generic iphone charger got it quick very pleased with purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente estado, no hubo inconveniente alguno.
<<&&&&>>
Great Phone great conditions
<<&&&&>>
This refurbished iPhone 8 arrived package well and on time. My wife absolutely loves it. The red color is stunning. It works perfectly as if it was brand new. Unfortunately headphones were not included nor was there a original equipment charger but those things aside this is a great phone at a great price.
<<&&&&>>
I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised). I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8 in 5 minutes tops. I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7. It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge. I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8 Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!
<<&&&&>>
These cannot possibly be certified refurbished as stated. Both phone batteries were so dead when I received them it took a day to charge. One phone has a camera that does not work.
<<&&&&>>
This phone did not work! It did turn on the first day and it overheated within 2 hours. The phone had a crack and after the first day the phone wouldn't turn off and the calibration was off. It couldn't read the password to get into the phone. I will never buy a phone from this company again!
<<&&&&>>
iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM What came in the box 1. iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM 2. Lightning Cable 3. USB Plug 4. Original Box What was not in the box 1. Earphones 2. SIM Card Removal Tool 3. User Manual The cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals. Earphones Have always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker. Phone Condition Body is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket. Screen Condition It came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine. A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside. It’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one I’ll never know, I guess some don’t care. I have a spare screen protector now. Battery Condition Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup. Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV. Setting it up Phone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory. Camera No scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp. Speakers No issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops. Microphone, Lighting Port No issues. Works. Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree. Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who. It’s as if it was all sold by one seller. Reviewers need to say who their seller was. My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most.  This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop. I don’t need the latest and greatest, a gently used phone is just as good.
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone. Seemed in very good condition. However, it Would not boot up. It stayed on the Apple screen for over an hour. I’m done requested a refund and returned the phone.
<<&&&&>>
My 2 iPhone purchase did not come with headphones. On the description it mentions headphones. The charges are not the same either.
<<&&&&>>
I phone 8 is in good condition and works as it should. Only came with the phone itself and charge cord. No plug for cord was included. Shipping took longer than expected. Was to be delivered 11/28 and arrived December 5, 2019. minimal directions on activating the phone.
<<&&&&>>
I loved my iPhone! Arrived on time, no scratches, unlocked, working perfectly. I just needed to go to Metropcs to authorize the SIM card.
<<&&&&>>
Feels and looks like a brand new one.
<<&&&&>>
Couldn’t tell it was refurbished.
<<&&&&>>
Really nice... It seems a brand new iPhone 8, out of the box. At first, I wasn't sure whether I should buy or not because of there are a lot of negative reviews for this particular phone along with its seller (vendor). Thus far, I have no issue with the iPhone 8. Of course, all consumers would be so cautious when he/she is looking for a refurbished/used phone. If I were to pick one minor thing that this phone should have is that "No place for an ear-pieces." Other than this particular one is missing, I would highly recommend to others to consider if you're looking for a refurbished iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came shipped with a glass screen protector which is a nice touch. Product was everything I expected, IOS says battery health is at 88% which is normal considering it’s age, overall very pleased with my purchase. Will definitely be buying from this merchant again when I need a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Standard iPhone 8 working great only thing it came in a box that said mobile device phone on it total knock off really cheesy and the headphones and charging stuff was gone it was also very clear that it was refurbished
<<&&&&>>
The phone overall is just fine. I thought that the battery would be leaps and bounds better than my 6S. It is a marked improvement but certainly doesn’t last all day with typical usage. The phones were received with no packaging around it. The phone was in the iPhone box but the box had opened in transit and when the box was opened the phone was faced down in the box. I am concerned on the long-term jostling that the phone received in transit.
<<&&&&>>
Mine has what looks to be a couple of fingerprint smudges under the glass from when it was refurbished. Other than that annoying thing the phone works great.
<<&&&&>>
Not sure it’s been 3 days however it arrived in time with no scratches on it an looked new... it’s to early to confirm if it is mechanically sound .. so far so good
<<&&&&>>
He said this is the best phone for him at any price. (Later Apple phones did stupid things like remove the home key)
<<&&&&>>
I am very satisfied with this Purchase. Great price for 256 GB I phone ! It works very well screen is brilliant all the features work great ! Today was the third day and battery life was better than my older I phone. Need to charge it after 2 days.
<<&&&&>>
It was in mint condition and works perfect. It came with a box and charger.
<<&&&&>>
Not the best ..wont. Keep charge..... hard to hear sometimes
<<&&&&>>
Great iPhone. Love how easy it was to set up.
<<&&&&>>
Did not know that apple would void warranty
<<&&&&>>
Working perfect so far. Good buy.
<<&&&&>>
10/10 would recommend this product. It took less then a week to arrive and when it did it looked brand new in mint condition with a screen protector on. The fingerprint reader works perfectly and it came a brand new charging cord and charging box which both work perfectly. Over all this product is definitely worth the price.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone for the price! It may be refurbished but it’s like new!
<<&&&&>>
Came and wouldn't even turn on, contacting the seller resulted in silence. Lots of places to get refurbished phones, make sure this isn't one of the places you do.
<<&&&&>>
Seems to be working fine and shipped fast.
<<&&&&>>
excellent
<<&&&&>>
I guess it’s best to get Apple certified refurbished iPhones. This one can’t get a photo or video, or even make a phone call, for very long without shutting down. (Not like a standard crash that returns you to the home screen—instead, the phone just powers off.)
<<&&&&>>
Great value. Can't tell it from a new original one from Apple.
<<&&&&>>
Phone worked great when it worked. Daily unexpected resets, and final shutdown without recovery. Amazon renew gives comfort, it’s hit or miss.
<<&&&&>>
Device powers down randomly during regular use.
<<&&&&>>
Product was delived on time, it was easy to set up. It looks new.
<<&&&&>>
Don’t always like fingerprint reader, but can always use password instead.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived on time. There are a few scratches on the screen, but nothing major. The camera and the fingerprint reader work perfectly. The battery runs out quite fast, tho.
<<&&&&>>
Good product, but the battery is not as strong as desired since it is a used phone.
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks brand new and came with a screen protector on it! Couldn’t be more thrilled!
<<&&&&>>
No good
<<&&&&>>
Appearance as new. Operates perfectly. Included screen protector, charging cable and AC adapter. Very happy with purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I haven’t had it long, but it came quickly it seems to work very well and fast. I really can’t say yet about battery life.
<<&&&&>>
It has problems with the headset, you can not hear well. Don’t by renew, the charger wasn’t original.
<<&&&&>>
As expected
<<&&&&>>
This was a good buy for me.
<<&&&&>>
Quality, excellent, delivery time excellent, pricing excellent,
<<&&&&>>
Phone looked like it was in good condition but the rear camera did not work.
<<&&&&>>
Me agradó recibir a tiempo y en buenas condiciones el celular. Hasta ahora funciona muy bien.
<<&&&&>>
was just as described. works like new.
<<&&&&>>
So far so good. Looks and works like new at considerably less than new price.
<<&&&&>>
Came with 93% battery maximum capacity and every feature works well.
<<&&&&>>
Wonderful phone
<<&&&&>>
Weird packaging but worked as advertised
<<&&&&>>
box wiyhout manual
<<&&&&>>
Like brand new! Thank you so much!
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
IPhone received without SIM Card holder and had to return it. I was disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this cell phone because I thought it was an iPhone 8 plus as it looked in the photos, if it is not an iPhone 8 plus why put a photo of an iPhone plus?
<<&&&&>>
Given all the reviews I've seen about this, I've decided to not purchase from these people. I've done more research and found that this is not only sketchy but also poorly done one of my main problems is this: If this is for a iPhone8, then why is the photos in the description of it an iPhone 8 plus? If you're going to lie / cheat / trick people, you might as well make it a convincing lie
<<&&&&>>
i really wish this was free but i love the nice color of the phone awesome phone
<<&&&&>>
I upgraded from a 64gb iPhone 5s to the iPhone8 with 256gb and I appreciate the increase size and storage. Transfer of my data was easy; just put the 5s next to the 8 and the transfer was seamless. All of my apps were transferred which made me very happy. I recommend this iPhone and the vendor. It came with an iPhone plugin charger & cable. The phone was charged when it arrived. I used the sim pin from my 5s to move my SIM card from the 5s to the 8. Although it didn’t come in an official Apple box, it was well packaged and looks brand new.
<<&&&&>>
11/21/2019 I bought this phone in August, arrived in original packaging with an Apple charger- worked great with no problems! Like new, camera worked great, absolutely no issues. However, my phone got stolen from me at the end of October. So I ordered a second one- complete opposite experience. Came in a small, dirty box with some weird charger. Had obvious scratches on the screen, and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality. I had been waiting for 3 weeks to replace my phone so I gave it a shot anyway... the microphone did not work at all. When people called, I could hear them and they couldn't hear me- which I had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from AAA, who hung up on me upon my "lack" of response when I answered the phone. Took it to T Mobile and chatted online with Apple to do some troubleshooting- turns out it's just a bad refurbished phone, so the only answer was to return it. Disappointed overall- good luck with your order... 12/2/2019 Increasing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Still leaving off one star for the 1 busted up phone, and 1 star for the inconvenience and 3 weeks of waiting to replace my phone- as well as both times the shipping delayed, (however only by 1 day each time, but I think I should mention it since it is listed "Prime FREE Delivery"). I ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone. THANK GOODNESS IT PAID OFF. I got another phone, quality as good as the first one. I leave this review after 1.5 weeks of phone 3 with no issues. I will update my review if anything changes but currently I am relieved it worked out.
<<&&&&>>
Defectuoso
<<&&&&>>
The phone looked undamaged. When turning it on, the Apple logo came on and would not advance any further than that. I tried several different ways to reboot it, but it stayed in the same position. I even called Apple and they could not get it to reboot. I called the seller but they were closed for the day. When I pay over $400 for an item, I expect it to work when it comes out of the box. I called Amazon, and they informed me to send it back and I would get a full refund, so I did just that.
<<&&&&>>
Unfortunately the phone has been returned to seller. It was a charcoal colored phone I received but the order said space gray. This was not the reason I returned it however. As soon as I received it, I installed a tempered glass screen protector. which worked very poorly in getting responses from the touch screen. Idid not realize that this was the fault of the screen protector until I had received authorization for a return. Just prior to boxing it up, I removed the protector and found out it now worked perfectly. Oh well live and learn. I will be repairing my older iphone 8 Plus and using that until I can can buy another phone hopefully in the next 8 months.
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks and works as though it was new. I wish they would give a tiny bit of history behind these phones but if I had to guess this couldn't have been owned very long. Maybe previously open box or return item. It came with a screen protector placed perfectly. Bonus!
<<&&&&>>
I Purchased this phone and spent five hours downloading all of my stuff and charging the battery. I put the Sim card in and made a phone call and I could hear the people perfectly but they couldn’t hear me. Had to return.
<<&&&&>>
I liked paying cash for my phone rather than paying the phone company in increments. Much savings. The "refurbished" phone looks like and works as if new. I believe it probably WAS new, just a return from someone else. Advantageous for me!
<<&&&&>>
Phone had 95% battery, very minor scratches on the screen that was only visible when the screen was off and turned towards a bright light. I don’t think I’ll ever buy a new phone again because of the amount i saved.
<<&&&&>>
The phone will not even turn on/power up, after a full day of charging. Do not buy from this seller, since they are apparently not ensuring that the product works before shipping it.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t have one blemish on the phone and it works great.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this as an upgrade for my SE. More than satisfied. Worthy buy just as my SE back then. Product arrived on time and with no problems whatsoever from RENEWED CELLULAR.
<<&&&&>>
Device was not unlocked to metropcs.
<<&&&&>>
Scratches and not as big a screen as I thought It would be. I may return and move up to a plus
<<&&&&>>
Great phone! Looks very new and in very good condition.
<<&&&&>>
Pretty awesome so far. Still learning how to use it, but I love it.
<<&&&&>>
Great condition!
<<&&&&>>
Looks like a new phone. Very happy with everything about it.
<<&&&&>>
The screen was cracked and the phone did not turn in after 24 hours of charging.
<<&&&&>>
It is not a Refurbished iphone, it is activated
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and this is my first picture with the back camera and also when Im tapping look like multitouch. There is any possibility to change the phone?
<<&&&&>>
This product is falsely labeled as unlocked, it's been 4 weeks since I informed that the phone was still locked and all I get are excuses. Plus, the phone came in a really bad condition, so many scratches you can see them very clearly.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price) trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could
<<&&&&>>
I loved how new this phone looks and works. Everything works and the battery life was at 94% which is very good. I am very glad with this purchase and definitely recommend buying from them. Very skeptical before buying but now having the product it is definitely worth a buy if you are looking for a good phone.
<<&&&&>>
Soy de Costa Rica, Compre el X de 256, la verdad estaba algo nervioso por ser reconstruido, pero lo recibo ( un dia antes de lo previsto), y considero que este es el mejor negocio que se puede hacer, la bateria esta al 100%, pantalla intacta, funciona de maravilla, es como comprarlo nuevo de Apple.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is basically New, everything works, no scratches or anything, fast delivery. Very satisfied !!
<<&&&&>>
The phone was reported STOLEN AND WAS SHUT OFF BY ATT. THIS SELLER IS A SCAMMER. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Straight out of the box the phone had A LOT of scratches both on the screen and back of the phone. Pretty disappointed, knew the phone was coming at a discount but it’s basically already ready for a screen replacement. The phone itself is super glitchy, can’t even sign in to my WiFi on the next screen. It also does not come with any original box nor headphones. One after market, cheap phone charger included.
<<&&&&>>
Love Love Love it came in perfect condition and it works perfect❤️❤️❤️❤️
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies in one hour in 3 months.
<<&&&&>>
all right, phone is new, I recommend them, thanks
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great
<<&&&&>>
My phone can't be enabled. How can I contact you?
<<&&&&>>
The device doesn’t support LTE plus poor housing box it arrived in. Other things works fine. Breakdown of the price is necessary for what I received 🤕
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone 5S performance was deteriorating and I decided to upgrade by getting this phone. I have Straight Talk by TracFone Inc. a GSM carrier, and received a refurbished iPhone X that was from Verizon and was able to insert my SIM card without any interruption of service. The only noticeable wear and tear on the iPhone I received was some marks that are barely noticeable on the touchscreen. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide if they should purchase this phone.
<<&&&&>>
The screen of the iPhone has a lots of scratches. I removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen. Refurbished means that product has been renewed, so a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated given the high price tag!
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone it came it a sketchy box and only with a charger and some paper. with a funky wrap around it. I got it out and it barely had any charge on it so I had to charge it before setup. once I got halfway threw the set up it turned black and said it was to to hot to function when it defiantly wasn't hot at all this was very disappointing. over all, after set up its a nice phone just couldn't get over the repetition of the same problem and so I had it refunded.
<<&&&&>>
Estimados el celular que compré no está liberado no puedo usarlo
<<&&&&>>
I have had the phone for several days now. Everything functions perfectly - camera, battery life, speakers, face recognition, etc., and it looks brand new. I read several reviews that mentioned that you can’t turn the camera click off - no problem here. And there was no issue getting it set up with our service provider (Sprint). When considering buying this phone based on reviews, consider a few things: this is hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying one new, Amazon’s return service is impeccable so if worst comes to worst, just return it and get another one, and also consider the fact that on average only roughly 10% of people even bother writing Amazon reviews and that a majority of the people leaving 1 star reviews probably wouldn’t have written a review at all if everything checked out like this phone did (I almost forgot to write a review myself). Then consider the fact that a majority of reviewers gave the phone 5 stars and you begin to see how if you’re interested in saving money this is an excellent route as you’re not likely going to do much better than this for the money.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great. However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera. As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!). Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference. TLDR: nice phone, in great condition, good price, came on time, but this particular phone is unusable for anyone who likes to take pictures
<<&&&&>>
This phone would not activate on the Sprint Network. Does not appear to be fully unlocked, despite what it says in the description.
<<&&&&>>
The item came exactly as describes so there is no complaints! The battery life span was at 92% when it came so hopefully that’s good. Everything is working great! The phone is in good condition with no flaws. However, it doesn’t have as long as a battery life as my old iPhone 7 does and it runs out of battery much quicker. BUT that may just be the iPhone x itself and it is as expected since it’s more complicated than the iPhone 7 so it may need to use up more battery life. I don’t really know. But other than that the phone is really good and I would definitely recommend this seller.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone X I received was in pretty good condition considering it's a used phone that is made purely or glass, Battery was at 86% life span which is good considering the phone is 2 years ago, almost $400 off retail and it feels just as fast as an iPhone XS, well worth the money.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this iPhone for my wife. I got the product and the moment I took the phone in my hand, I could find the Siri button felt little different/loose than my existing iPhone X(which I purchased brand new a year back). Also noticed a major scratch on central frame which would have caused original display damage. Also I could totally see that the display was replaced and the sealing glue was oozing out from left upper side of display. Such kind of phone would not stand against water spills. It took me just 5 mins to figure out the product I was delivered was horribly repaired. I didn’t expect this from Amazon! Very very disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
This item is claimed to be a "functioning like new" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail. I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true. As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into "settings" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck. As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head. I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry* a bride from this father-in-law. Happy phone hunting!
<<&&&&>>
Really nice phone, small Minor scuffing by the power button but it’s in excellent shape. Worked great going from older iPhone SE on T-Mobile. Took out SIM card and put in new device and worked automatically.
<<&&&&>>
No se prende el cel y está súper mal estéticamente quiero que me devuelva mi plata 😩
<<&&&&>>
My boy is pleased
<<&&&&>>
Lovable 5 stars. Works perfect 🙏😁
<<&&&&>>
4/29: Wow! I really thought that this could go south, however, once it arrived it was working as a brand new iPhone, luckily I had a key to open the SIM tray, otherwise I would have had a hard time finding a way to open it. It's been now almost 3 weeks since first started to use the phone and not one trace of a damage or defect has been found and I like all of the features it includes. Kudos to the seller Electronic Deals who sent this one like new and made me happy for the upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone X. UPDATE 6/9: This phone has not failed at all since first use, the only detail is that when you turn it back on, unless it is plugged to the charger wire, it will take a lot of time to boot up, other than that, there are absolutely no complains for this product.
<<&&&&>>
THey claim it includes an ‘OEMA/C Adapter & Data Cable’ but you do not! You get a cheap china adapter and cable.
<<&&&&>>
Estuve leyendo las opiniones de quienes habian comprado antes este teléfono, y no me convencia, pero lo decidi y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra. Llego dos dias antes de lo anunciado por paqueteria. En muy buenas condiciones, la bateria con 98% vida util sin un solo rasguño, como nuevo, funciona muy bien y lo estoy usando en mexico con la compañia telcel, hasta ahorita todo funciona bien lo tengo desde hace 7 dias.
<<&&&&>>
Terrible. Screen completey does whatever it wants goes crazy and doesn’t let you have any control.
<<&&&&>>
Got exactly what I ordered, came with the phone and a charger. Arrived before expected and put a huge smile on my son's face on Christmas morning. Works fine with cricket wireless.
<<&&&&>>
Gets hot when I’m listening to music or watching a video
<<&&&&>>
Phone was a gift for friend they are very pleased with iPhone x
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit hesitant to order this phone because I've never ordered a phone from a retailer instead of the company itself. It arrived on the date predicted and I've had it for about three weeks now. It showed up in a plain white box in a bit of a dirty envelope but the phone itself was fine, it didn't have any scratches or dents or anything. Managed to set it up with my service provider that same day. It turned up with about 20% charge, a charger, and a SIM card pin. I recommend order headphone jack adapters or lightning headphones before you get this phone, if this is your first time using an iPhone like me. All things considered, a good purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente opción. Buen celular, el mío salió perfecto, sin rayones. Buena batería, por la mitad de precio de uno nuevo. El cargador no es original y sin audífonos. Excellent option. No scratches in the screen, good battery and for half of the price of a new one. No original charger, no headphones.
<<&&&&>>
I’m not going to lie, reading the reviews i was really sketched. To me it seemed like there was a 50/50 chance you could get a bad phone. But I can only speak for me personally and it’s an almost perfect phone that I recieved. Not a single scratch and even came with the glass screen protector on there. The battery was at 91% which I wasn’t fond of but if that’s all that’s wrong with it, I’ll take it for the price. But I went in with the mindset that if I get a bad one, I can just keep sending it back till I get a good one, but the one I got is almost flawless. I love the phone. So don’t pay attention to the reviews, it’s a great phone and hey, if you get one that’s not in great condition, Amazon is great at returns. (I’m actually writing this review from the new phone now.)
<<&&&&>>
I am skeptical when reading thru all the comments, but since my Nexus 6 is so slow and laggy, I decided to buy it anyway. I did a research and saw BuySpry has good review so I gave it a chance. It has been almost 1 month since I have it, and it is wonderful, running very smooth. It has a little scratch on the screen but it is acceptable for an used iPhone. My phone came with 95% battery health which is excellent. No complaint so far. POSITIVE and HAPPY with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Estéticamente perfecto, funcionó de la mejor manera pocos días y pero luego no reconocía ninguna red móvil. Hice el reclamo y la devolución y recibí a los pocos días un reembolso completo sin objeciones. Vendedor 100% recomendable.
<<&&&&>>
Not compatible with my carrier as listed.
<<&&&&>>
I would not buy a renewed or refurbished phone. I am sending this back with the 90 day guarantee.
<<&&&&>>
We ordered 2 phones. One for my husband and one for me. Husbands works perfect. Mine wouldn’t sync. No matter how many times I tried. So I returned it. Got another one from the same company. This time the screen has a black spot in the corner that won’t light and the screen flickers on and on like crazy while I’m using it. It comes and goes but the corner is damaged for sure. Retuning a second time to try again. Haven’t even gotten a chance to try the camera yet... will post an updated
<<&&&&>>
I am incredibly satisfied! The phone came in perfect condition! It had about an 80% of battery life upon arrival, and the phone synced from my other device smoothly. My SIM card immediately worked once I put it in. The phone came with no scratches at all, looks brand new! I think it’s worth it! The photos are great! The storage is 64g just like I ordered. It came with an adapter, phone charger, and SiIM tray ejecter. UPDATE: Two days later, I found out that I could make calls and receive them just well, but I can’t hear the person on the other line, unless it’s on speaker. Yet, they can hear me just fine. So, I contacted the seller to see if I can get a replacement. I’ll update as soon as something happens.
<<&&&&>>
Please read before buying: My phone has been holding up great after a month of using it. Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won’t turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I’d say that I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it’s a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i’ve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn’t been entirely paid off. Also, their “refurbishments” aren’t really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There’s only one problem that really isn’t that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished. Better safe than scammed.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my husband and have absolutely no complaints. Looks like a brand new phone. The only thing to note is that you receive a generic charger and no headphones as you would with a brand new phone. But for the price difference, its worth buying your own headphones. I liked the peace of mind having 90 days to use it to make sure it works correctly. So far it is perfect.
<<&&&&>>
Good value. No problems
<<&&&&>>
Simply amazing. Everything working perfectly, including the charger that is shipped with the phone. Couldn’t be happier. Spending so much money online made me nervous of a scam, but luckily this product was delivered as advertised. No visible scratches, it looks new!
<<&&&&>>
I love the iPhone X, however when I first received I noticed a deep scratch on the phone. I thought It was on the screen protector that came on the phone. Gave me some few minor problems with swiping up mostly annoying till a couple months later. I wake up and pick up my phone and the bottom portion of the phone screen is completely unresponsive. Very upset that I paid a great amount on a phone that has obvious problems, covered up by screen protector. Very deceptive of on part of the seller not to mention the problem. Should’ve bought straight from Apple instead from a deceptive seller with a good a price.
<<&&&&>>
My updated review: (2 stars): Had some issues with the phone. Battery life quickly plummeted to 80% and noticeably discharged faster. Camera lens seems unstable and rattles sometimes taking blurry pictures and video. I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn’t do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might not My initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape. Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear. But there is a noticeable scratch in the display that is visible at greater than 12in distance. [seller offered to replace with another or a $20 rebate]
<<&&&&>>
I would not buy this product again. I received it with a cracked screen. I didn't even use this item because I received it as a cracked screen and immediately decided I no longer wanted it. I would love to be able to review it properly if received without cracked screens so my first impression was not very good. Definitely not worth the money spent.
<<&&&&>>
bad
<<&&&&>>
WOW At first I didn’t trust the sellers because of the reviews BUT the phone I got was perfect. The battery is 97% it’s original state which is awesome. There are literally no scratches or marks ANYWHERE. But it didn’t come in original packaging which kinda sucked BUT ALL I CARED ABOUT WAS THE PHONE AND IT WAS GREAT WHAT A DEAL.
<<&&&&>>
I loved how it took 3 days to get here. The phone is in perfect condition, almost brand new. Doesn’t come with a screen protector like other refurbished phones but no worry I bought one. It came half way charged which was great regarding setup. The speakers work, I received the correct phone 256GB, fully unlocked. Amazing phone, definitely worth the price.
<<&&&&>>
I loved the price of this phone. But you deff get what you paid for. The battery life sucks. The phone glitches when I type and constantly deletes everything I’ve typed without anyway of stopping it. The phone freezes and closing all the apps doesn’t help nor does locking and unlocking it. I’ve tried resetting it too and it sucks too. I waited to give a review to get enough time with the phone to give a better review.
<<&&&&>>
The phone function fine as expected. Unlock and good to use international. The phone I receive got a lot of scratches in the back. However, I use cases on my phone so this doesn’t bother me too much.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone to replace my iPhone 6. The battery life on this does not last as long and it seems to be very glitchy. Sometimes my screen will have various colored lines through it or it gets stuck or frozen for no reason. I assume this is because I bought it refurbished but I should have just gotten it now .
<<&&&&>>
No scratches, works great, would recommend
<<&&&&>>
Got the phone yesterday, beside a little scratch on the front screen, the phone looks great, just like brand new. Batter life is at 89%, this could be better but I’m ok with it. It came with a pre-installed screen protector that it’s a bit wide placed, but it’s a not a issue. The value for the money is 11/10
<<&&&&>>
A few scratches here and there but it works like a charm!
<<&&&&>>
Call
<<&&&&>>
Brand new
<<&&&&>>
Excelente! everything is fine!
<<&&&&>>
Great product. Cheap. Mine looks brand new, battery is amazing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.
<<&&&&>>
I don’t have it set for face or finger print reader. I’d rather just have a password. I love having storage space for all my apps I had to give up because older phone had no space and had to keep deleting them until I only had one. I’m still learning what all my phone can do, and haven’t gotten everything setup perfect yet but I’m grateful to have found this phone. I love it. It takes great pictures.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little hesitant to buy this phone used because you don't really know the exact condition of the phone but when the phone arrived, upon inspection the phone looked brand new, no scratches or anything. It even came with a screen protector probably from the original owner. The phone works great, no issues at all. The only thing I don't like is the lack of the original box and cables. It comes in a little orange box with no brand cables and it did not come with the earbuds. That's not a big problem though as description states that it doesn't and the phone is at least $300 off retail. Overall, very happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Seeing how these reviews are about these phones coming in like hot garbage, I decided to take the risk and believed in the company sending me the phone to give me one that isn't like the others. Believing I did right, seeing how they technically gave me a brand new phone with a 100% battery life and almost no scratches on the screen (probably 2 week old phone that broke). Honestly, if you're feeling lucky this is a way to go. It's 100% worth paying this price since it's technically a steal. However, you risk getting these trashy phones I keep seeing in the reviews. I wouldn't know, but if you ever decide to buy from them, hope you get the one you need.
<<&&&&>>
Everything is basically perfect I really have not bad to say about it I may update if something goes wrong but it doesn’t look that way, super happy
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the space grey 256gb iphone x. I got and it is damn near mint. No marks no scratches, even tho it was still on iOS 12 I did upgrade it to iOS 13.2r. I upgraded from a 6s+ and im pleased with the peice of mind from amazon, and not taking a gamble on ebay.
<<&&&&>>
The screen would just go black all the time and it would have these green lines and wouldn’t work for long periods of time. I had to leave it on and turn off the auto 30 second lock just so I could use it. Tried to return it and it came with a small crack on the back of the phone. Can’t return it because I dropped it on accident while packaging it to return. Would never buy another phone from here. I need my phone for work and I was unable to communicate with my coworkers which was an issue when it would turn off without being on the charger.
<<&&&&>>
It comes in a weird box with a crappy charger. It looks like the back had little dents in the glass. Like it had come in contact with sand inside the case or something like that. Apart from that the phone was in good condition, the front glass was smooth, battery capacity is at 91%, i havent had any issues with the phone.
<<&&&&>>
I can say it’s one of the best phone It really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger 🔌 and it’s pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however.....
<<&&&&>>
Lots of mixed reviews. I was worried about what I would see once I opened the package. Absolutely no scratches on the screen or the back of the phone. It came with a screen protector, charger and the tool to access sim card. I had to look real good to find a little wear around the edges of the phone, but nothing extremely noticeable. It was very close to a new phone when it came to appearance. It also came with a full battery. After reading the reviews I guess it is just hit and miss with these phones.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is good, only some light visible scratches on the screen, but the charger is defective, doesn’t work properly. The cable seems to be burnt.
<<&&&&>>
Ordered a 256 GB for AT&T. Product came with minor scuffs on the sides of the phone that were easily covered by a cheap case. IMEI was clean and I just slid in the SIM card from my old iPhone to get signal. Battery life was at 85%. Solid 8/10 quality but well worth the discount over buying new. Will update if any issues arise.
<<&&&&>>
Doesn’t look like new at all. A lot of scratches on screen and the sides. It’s a used phone used by a person with not care (didn’t used a cover or a any kind of screen protection. I’m so disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
Came with charging cable that didn't work phone
<<&&&&>>
Todo había estado muy bien, pero al mes empezó a fallar de la pila, y ahora ya no sirve después de otro mes
<<&&&&>>
Celular excelente los accesorios no son originales
<<&&&&>>
Great iPhone service quick thanks highly recommend
<<&&&&>>
Sim locked to original GSM owner. Original phone owner iCloud locked phone with find my iPhone after I had it for a day
<<&&&&>>
I am so happy with how this phone arrived! It arrived quickly and looks completely brand new. It came with 96% battery life so I was very pleased with that and everything works on it just as it should!
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone I received is in prestine condition and even came with a screen protector already installed. Not a single scratch or scuff mark anywhere on the phone. Literally is a brand new phone. Battery life is at 98%! I’m extremely happy.
<<&&&&>>
Basically a new looking phone at a discount
<<&&&&>>
I have just received this product, and I was excited until I noticed a large, 2 1/2 inch crack on the screen. I have hesitated to turn it on as I am in the process of requesting a return. This review will remain at 2 stars until I receive a refund or replacement.
<<&&&&>>
Renewed, works like new. Came with a generic charger but no issues so far, and it's been a few weeks. No cosmetic damage from what I can see either.
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit nervous buying such a pricey phone refurbished, but I was very impressed. Battery came at 95% health, the device came with a screen protector and generic accessories (which were actually better than what normally is included), and the only imperfection was a small scratch that I hope is in the screen protector but is hardly noticeable. For half the price of the new phone, this was incredible quality
<<&&&&>>
Phone has looked and acted like NEW since day one. Was definitely a risk buying something so expensive refurbished but it absolutely worked out this time. If all the refurbished phones come like this I HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the $400 difference from a new Iphone X 265GB.
<<&&&&>>
I had this phone for only 4 months and it completely broke. I brought it to a football game and it was in my pocket, zipped up the whole time. After the game it just started flashing the apple logo. I took it to a phone repair store and they opened it up and were surprised it ever worked, saying a lot was wrong within. Just pay the money and get your phone from apple/whatever your cell carrier is.
<<&&&&>>
I requested a silver one and got a gray one. Extremely disappointed as nobody reviewed the product and compared it with my original order
<<&&&&>>
As soon as I took it out of the box it wouldn't turn on. It didn't have any scratches or anything but it simply wouldn't charge and therefore couldn't use it. I was very dissapointed because it had such great reviews and I waited so long to receive it.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is an upgrade from my last one and the storage is great, but when I received my phone I noticed scratches on the screen. No big deal, but then I realized they were cracks on the screen and not just scratches. Highly disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
my phone was coming up as lost or stolen when i tried to get it activated
<<&&&&>>
I would highly recommend this product. It’s been working fine so far.. only funny thing is the face recognition sometimes mixes my mum’s face and I.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve been using this phone for 1 month now,I can have any complaints about this phone EXCEPT for the battery health...my current battery is 11%,but guess what,I only use my phone for 3 hours,yet its dying🤢Everything else went super smooth except for battery!!!but still,if u are not a guy who is on his phone for 24/7,then u should definitely purchase this iPhone X
<<&&&&>>
I like that the phone is easy to use. And the phone is reliable.
<<&&&&>>
it come to chance the battery, according to apple the maximum is 500 cycles
<<&&&&>>
I’m loving it! So worth it!
<<&&&&>>
The battery life has no as long..
<<&&&&>>
The phone has issues with the touch screen Am very disappointed with the phone
<<&&&&>>
Great buy ! Works like new and the battery health was 100% when I first got it. It’s at 99% now though. Only thing is the Product came with a generic charger however I’m not too mad about that because I can just buy the original Apple charger but apart from that everything is great . Oh the phone also came with a tempered glass . Worth the cost !
<<&&&&>>
Returned it bc I didn’t need it but it was exactly as described
<<&&&&>>
When I received the iPhone X from BuySPRY, everything worked great. But then after using the phone for 92 days, it shuts down out of the blue and does not power back up. And sure enough, the warranty with the seller ended after 90 days. I took it to the Genius Bar for a diagnosis and they guess it was a bad processor and could not be fixed.
<<&&&&>>
I like that it came nice and clean and even had a screen protector on it. Literally not a single flaw this phone is perfect for the price. Only used for a day battery is good but seems as it charges slow.
<<&&&&>>
Good price, excellent shape. Battery has 87%,left of life.
<<&&&&>>
Can’t say anything bad. Like the phone and haven’t had issues. 90%battery life when it arrived.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived looking beautiful and new, but once we set it up and tried making a call it became apparent that the audio was not functional. I could only hear and be heard when on speaker phone. I was bummed, and I was even more bummed that There was no option to exchange the phone for a working one and I had to return it instead.
<<&&&&>>
My money was well spent! My phone came in earlier than the day expected and it easily transferred my information from my old iPhone to my new iPhone X! The only issue that I’ve noticed was a very tiny crack in the top right corner of the phone (not the screen) which isn’t even noticeable if you aren’t looking for it. Great buy.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, which was neat, and had fade scratches on the back. The stainless steel on the sides has a decent amount of scuffs, which is predictable for its price. But the phone functionality is great judging by the 100% battery life which I am amazed with. All in all it’s a pretty decent purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I would rate this product 5 stars but the front camera came with a little dust and it does influence the definition. The battery takes a bit longer than usual to charge but it's ok. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend the product! It came with a free screen protector :)
<<&&&&>>
iPhone came sooner than estimated. Phone came in perfect condition. Only came with a charger tho. Didn’t get the pin for sim reader but a safety pin works fine if you use it the right way. Phone came with glass screen protector put on already. Do research on who your buying from. I got mine from mastertronics.
<<&&&&>>
Slight scathes around edges of back of phone. Battery life at 93%. Other than those things works like new, super fast and premium feeling
<<&&&&>>
The phone is working great and didn’t come with any scratches or anything wrong with it, everything works well and the battery life is great lasts all day and The company the phone is from is a recycling company so they take phones and fix them. There was no problems.
<<&&&&>>
Súper perfect quelity Excelent love it si fast delivery and good product
<<&&&&>>
Advertisement said completely new screen and no cosmetic defects, but screen is scratched, and I'll have to return this phone. This is extremely inconvenient as I have no phone without this.
<<&&&&>>
Sold us a stolen phone so we couldn't activate it. We ended up returning it and just purchasing a new one through our phone plan.
<<&&&&>>
No obvious dings or dents, simple packaging, off brand charger but that’s okay, best deal out there from the research I did. I’m pleased so hopefully, dear reader, you will be as well!
<<&&&&>>
This phone was manufactured for Japan so you can’t turn off the camera shutter sound! Very loud and very annoying. I never would have bought this phone if I’d known this. There is nothing in description that discloses this info.
<<&&&&>>
It was practically brand new as far as the condition. Only thing was that the battery was at 90% life but its a steal either way. Extremely satisfied. Had iPhone 6+ previously
<<&&&&>>
Not the same phone and it’s bad
<<&&&&>>
The phone is fine. Good shipping, packaging, etc. However, I believe this phone was meant for the Korean or Japanese market as there is no way to silence the camera shutter on this device. US buyers - be wary as these phones may have been made for different markets and are being resold.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is fast and works like new. I wouldn’t have know I got it used
<<&&&&>>
Great phone. Purchased it renewed. Unfortunately had to send it back to the seller since the phone randomly rebooted. The customer service was excellent.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little leery after reading some of the negative reviews. I bought this phone for my daughter and it works great! No issues at all and it looks brand new. It was about $350 cheaper than a new one. Shipped fast too as I received it the next day
<<&&&&>>
Love it, stays up with my busy life
<<&&&&>>
I like it a lot but it seems to be running into a little trouble following my directions and I’ve lost the voice-sound on a couple of the applications. I didn’t think I would need to have it tune up so soon after I got it . But over all I pretty happy with it .
<<&&&&>>
I like but sometimes it starts out ringing normal then goes way low
<<&&&&>>
I like this phone a lot doesn’t even have a scratch on it I’m very satisfied with it. I read the reviews on the seller and that’s why I went with this seller they spoke the truth so far I think I got a good deal.
<<&&&&>>
Impecable, superando expectativas
<<&&&&>>
Ok
<<&&&&>>
Works well and yet to see how the battery behaves over time.....
<<&&&&>>
screen slightly scratched but otherwise satisfied. Love the iPhone X.
<<&&&&>>
It works & that's all that matters
<<&&&&>>
Great phones
<<&&&&>>
Thank you
<<&&&&>>
The phone works with metropcs. Battery maximum capacity is 100% which is really good. Although it’s an amazon prime renewed product, for the price it’s a very good deal.
<<&&&&>>
Me llego como dice el anuncio con dos pequeños raspones que no afectan al uso, a las dos semanas de usar se daño el speaker de oído, espero que no tenga mas problemas. la batería si llego al 94%.
<<&&&&>>
Love
<<&&&&>>
Everything I expected
<<&&&&>>
I am completeley amazed by how new the phone looks. Everyting works perfect, the phone has no scratches, neither does the screen and it even arrived with a glass protector on the screen. I am very satisfied with my purchase!!! Thank you!
<<&&&&>>
Phone WAS not fully unlocked. Will be returning.
<<&&&&>>
Gift
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as promised, in excellent condition and shipped quickly. Thanks!
<<&&&&>>
I went to AT&T to purchase new 11 and decided to go online to Amazon. I’m happy I did! This phone is nice, takes a few days to learn how to use it. I just ordered another for my hubby. Great value
<<&&&&>>
Very good phone
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Amazing!!! Flawless phone!!! SOOOO worth it!!! Thanks!!
<<&&&&>>
Great product work like a new phone
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
Sells phones locked to att/T-Mobile yet says fully unlocked in discription.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is great and although it says that it is gsm unlocked, my carrier said the phone is somehow not compatible with it. (My company is Sprint). I don’t understand, gsm unlocked should mean that that it’s able to connect to my provider no?
<<&&&&>>
IPhone x 256gb for $760 it’s a Good price for great brand The only thing I don’t like it came with not original accessories
<<&&&&>>
Still working perfectly
<<&&&&>>
Good Deal, Buyspry customers service is amazing and they really helpful.
<<&&&&>>
Mi iPhone venia con la cámara rota y el micrófono no funcionaba bien, lo devolví
<<&&&&>>
My phone arrived quickly and seems to be almost “brand new.” I could not find any small scratches or sign of exterior wear. The battery life is incredible. I have had the phone for a couple of months now and have not had a single problem!
<<&&&&>>
Easy SIM swap. Took the phone to an Apple store and it passed their diagnostics test. Very good price. Only problem is that it came with an unofficial charger cable and no headphones but that was expected.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in perfect condition. Very pleased.
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as described! My daughter lost her phone in a freak accident. This was the replacement option we decided to try. I'm really glad I did.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in great condition! It was delivered as expected. It also came with a Shatter glass protector on the phone
<<&&&&>>
Great price and excellent condition
<<&&&&>>
Great phone. Was worried about it being refurbished but otherwise is an awesome phone
<<&&&&>>
Worked perfect like if it was brand new out of the box.
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
I like the product a lot. But I have issues with the camera it’s not as crisp as a real iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is clearly from a foreign country as you cannot turn off the flash. It also has other software quirks. Functions fine but will be replacing in less than a year.
<<&&&&>>
Just what I wanted
<<&&&&>>
Seems all good so far
<<&&&&>>
Que no vino los audífonos ni el cargador original del teléfono
<<&&&&>>
Was very nervous to buy this phone, but couldnt be happier! 100% battery, looks like a new phone
<<&&&&>>
Successful refurbished iPhone!
<<&&&&>>
The phone came and the screen kept glitching out as soon as I start to set up the phone and only got worse with time. Made it extremely hard to do anything like typing or using apps.
<<&&&&>>
I called at&t and apple and of course apple blamed everything on at&t but it’s ok AT&T and cricket and the same thing AT&T owns cricket so the switch should be easy but it going to take some time
<<&&&&>>
I was first scared to buy this product after reading all the reviews but after receiving it looking brand new i was not disappointed. it connected easily to att and now works great!!
<<&&&&>>
Battery seems to go down quickly
<<&&&&>>
Nosotros lo compramos a principio de año y nos funcionó súper bien , en éstos días volveremos a comprar otro celular de éste mismo vendedor ya que estamos muy satisfechos.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone, only problem is the battery life isn’t the greatest & it won’t let me completely sign into apple services although I can still use the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Esta muy bien., pero no se le hicieron las pruebas suficientes de que servia., se reinicia solo y habeces se blokea la pantalla por completo., de ahi en fuera todo bien
<<&&&&>>
La traducción en español manifiesta GSM DESBLOQUEADO y resulta q tiene bloqueo estoy fuera de Estados Unidos y no puedo devolver Amazon no me da solución
<<&&&&>>
Excelente
<<&&&&>>
This phone was amazing! It didn’t come in original packing and sealing but it was secured and like new! Now scratches or anything. It even came with a tempered glass
<<&&&&>>
So far, so good.
<<&&&&>>
I just turned this phone on and it has a yellow line down the left side of the screen. I paid alot for this phone. Very disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
I was so disappointed with the quality and felt cheated by both the third party seller and Amazon. Do not buy!
<<&&&&>>
Perfect. The battery life is at 94% which is awesome for a refurbished phone.
<<&&&&>>
Like it for the price, haven’t had any issues with it.
<<&&&&>>
Facial recognition doesn’t work in the dark.
<<&&&&>>
Okay
<<&&&&>>
Hi guys, i really like the phone, but it's giving me hard time,keep freezing and then it says something about charge too
<<&&&&>>
The phone has a crack at the top of the screen. It is small but annoying.
<<&&&&>>
I bought it to my son . But it’s was with a crack between the cameras . It’s never happened with me before buying used iPhone 😭
<<&&&&>>
Very clean. and easy to setup
<<&&&&>>

I bought a refurbished iPhone that I received on June 24, 2018. On November 3, 2018, while using the phone, I could feel the phone getting way too hot (for no reason), and then it shut itself down. I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days. I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said “too bad, so sad” the warranty is 90 days. So, no, I do not recommend buying a refurbished iPhone, and I especially don’t recommend buying one from this third-party seller (Prime Mobility).
<<&&&&>>
Very pleased with my IPhone X 256 gb great price and great condition, works great with my AT&T SIM card, phone is like brand new
<<&&&&>>
Had two weeks to return it. My original intent was to have a big screen with a phone small enough for my pocket. I read all the negative reviews. It took a few days to learn buttonless mauvering...but I learned it. Facial ID perfect. But for day to day use with no fear of back glass breaking I decided to swap the X for the 7. But at the last moment I decided to keep the ten. It does have the largest screen yet fits in my pocket.
<<&&&&>>
Well this phone is really good went to apple to get it active and the I started to play games call friends and have friends I think it is great
<<&&&&>>
This is my favorite iPhone so far. I do think that  should be further ahead though. I’ve been a bit bored with iPhones when it comes to cool gimmicky features. Powerwise, I’m super satisfied! It is a work horse in your hands, all my programs open up fast with no lag. I’ve also gotten this phone wet on many occasions and it’s still going strong. I got it about a month after it hit stores. I don’t miss the headphone jack because I only use it with Bluetooth devices. For reference, I use Bose soundlink 360 II, Bose Mini, PowerBeats 3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II. They all connect great without a hitch. Some persons must have gotten a lemon. They should take it in to Apple, I’m sure they would exchange or repair your phone if you haven’t had it for more than a year.
<<&&&&>>
Apple told me to take the phone to BestBuy for service after it developed a bunch of lines on the screen. Best Buy tried for an hour to process the return and gave up saying Apple's software wouldn't accept it for service. I went back onto Apple's chat based support. It was in the evening and the person on chat struggled with English. After much back and forth she could not explain the potential charges.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had my phone for a little more than a month now and it works flawlessly and looked like new when I received it. I was so happy with it I bought my wife another one. It also has been working flawlessly and looked like new also. I have seen the bad reviews for this product and can either say they were unlucky or are making bogus reviews, I am 2/2 and very happy with my purchases. 2 like new phones for about $500 less than new cost. I would recommend this to my friends and family if that helps you with your decision.
<<&&&&>>
Thank you very much, it works excellent and I have not had any problems. Works with At&t Mexico perfectly.
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I purchased the renewed silver iPhone X and when it arrived, the microphone did not work. I could not record videos with sound, use Siri, or make calls AT ALL because of this. I returned it and ordered ANOTHER silver iPhone X and the screen would glitch. Random movements, swipes, and clicks would go through without me touching the screen. Both phones came from different vendors, by the way. DO NOT waste your time and money on a renewed phone. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a brand new phone that will actually work.
<<&&&&>>
STAY AWAY From APPLE products! When Apple’s Marketing Chief Phil Schiller gave his blessing to the iPhone X, "So if you happen to be hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water... don't worry, dive down, grab it, rinse it, let it dry, you'll be fine.” You would *Think* Apple would stand by its product. WRONG! As it happened to me, I stopped my phone in shallow water, only 3 feet deep, for a few seconds, and IMMEDIATELY my phone bricked. I purchased my iPhone X for $1199 and I would expect my phone would last a few years and have the peace of mind that my phone would still work after that incident. Well I was more than angry when Apple would not even attempt to replace my product, but charges me $549 to replace with a $#%$ refurbished product. The Staff at genius bar were snobby and would not even care! You work hard for you money, you spend your hard earn dollars for a good quality product, but APPLE is only scamming you and stealing from you! THINK ABOUT IT! Don’t buy what they advertise unless they guarantee it! PERIOD!
<<&&&&>>
I wasted over a grand on this phone. I’d had the iPhone 6 before and I wanted to upgrade because I’d heard good things about the camera. I wanted to take better pictures of my kids and figured it would be easier to spend the money on a phone than a camera . Wrong. Marginally better camera. NO thumb recognition. Just annoying and terrible. So disappointed
<<&&&&>>
I was super happy to get this phone when I first got it, everything worked perfectly fine, face ID worked, no scratches or anything... but the when I went up to sprint the next day they said the phone wouldn't work with there service cause this a GMS phone, and it wasn't capable with there service and I was very disappointed… I wouldn't recommend anyone to get a phone that says GMS on it because you have a high chance of the phone not working with any services especially if you have sprint... make it even worse once I got this phone that same day I got my debit card info hacked and had $732 dollars taken out of my bank account. so I wouldn't trust this company to buy phones from... im very upset with this phone and the seller

removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen. Refurbished means that product has been renewedso a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated seriously
<<&&&&>>
This device is unusable for me because the OLED PWM (pulse width modulation) causes headaches and eye strain. The lack of fingerprint sensor became a dealbreaker for me, as the swiping gestures are high friction (effort) and don't register consistently. I returned mine.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t want to rate it till I was sure . I’m sure. It’s great.
<<&&&&>>
What does renewed mean?
<<&&&&>>
I am so happy with my purchase! The phone is in perfect cosmetic condition, it looks brand new! The phone works great so far, quick and good battery life. It only took three days to arrive, it arrived a day earlier than expected. Great price, great deal! Definitely would recommend this seller and their products, you get exactly what you expect! :)
<<&&&&>>
All of the other reviews saying the 64 gb and the 256 gb are the same price are fake the 64 gb is $660 while the 256 gb is $790.
<<&&&&>>
It’s not a apple product, it’s a clone and at that price schould be apple product I’m. Returning this
<<&&&&>>
Muy buen telefono lo recomiendo
<<&&&&>>
Arrived in perfect condition, and works like new! Super happy!
<<&&&&>>
$900!! That’s the price for a new iphone X
<<&&&&>>
Really like for tween birthday present great for value and price.
<<&&&&>>
I love it! There are however a few scratches.
<<&&&&>>
Aún no lo he recibido, estoy tratando de comunicarme con un respetable y es detestable nadie responde nada
<<&&&&>>
I got my phone two day before it was supposed to be delivered no scratches perfect working condition came with a glass screen protector as well above and beyond what I was expecting
<<&&&&>>
No lo recomiendo..........la pantalla táctil falla a cada rato y hay programas que no puedes cerrar y Siri nada que resuelve
<<&&&&>>
I am really glad for this phone. Thumbs up, I recommend buying it. It’s worth buying
<<&&&&>>
did not come the headset and the charger is not original
<<&&&&>>
This is the best phone ever
<<&&&&>>
Perfecto
<<&&&&>>
I love the phone..
<<&&&&>>
Im so happy with this purchase i hope a nice phone :D
<<&&&&>>
bad!
<<&&&&>>
it was nice!
<<&&&&>>
en duda
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone's water resistance rating is pure garbage. I just drowned two phones in an inch of water within a few minutes. Anyone know of a class-action lawsuit for this?
<<&&&&>>
If you're looking for hundreds of dollars off an iPhone X this is the way to do it. The phone functions perfectly, battery health states it is 96%. Screen is in like new condition. I've always purchased refurb'd products from laptops to tablets to phones. Upon receiving this device I was a little disappointed regarding the description in comparison to the product I received. "The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away" The scratch on the lens that I've included a picture of wouldn't show up very well on my iPhone 6s's camera but I couldn't get it to focus on the back glass of the iPhone X with my horrific barracks lighting. The scratch I can visibly see when the phone is resting on a table in front of me.
<<&&&&>>
I called AT&T this morning to see if this phone can be unlocked and whether it truly came from a non-USA affiliate of AT&T. Mary, the AT&T representative tol me that: A) 250 days remain on the warranty, so phone is about 3-4 months old; B) phone is one of many purchased from AT&T (USA) on a payment plan that was not paid; C) the account used to purchase the phone was closed by AT&T's FRAUD TEAM; D) the phone DID NOT come from an AT&T affiliate, European or otherwise; and E) the phone is subject to being blacklisted for non-payment and *possible* fraud. I provided a copy of my Amazon.com invoice to document that I purchased the phone in good faith. Mary submitted a request to have this phone "cleared" in their system so it won't be blacklisted and can be unlocked. It will take 48-72 hours to find out if AT&T will do this. Apparently, there are a lot of phones like this one being sold on Amazon.com and other online marketplaces. Buyer beware. Do you really want to spend $1,000 + of your hard-earned money only to find out you were scammed?
<<&&&&>>
I’m surprised how brand new looking this refurbished phone is. No scratches or dents. Went to sprint to activate and it just works. Battery I can get a day and half
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in perfect condition!! I am more then pleased with this company. The phone is exactly as described!! I will buy from this company again in the future!!
<<&&&&>>
I received my phone in decent condition but notice after 10 mins using it would over heat then the screen all sudden there be like a glitch just terrible so I returned it
<<&&&&>>
Package came with it some random box. Do note this is not from apple. For my unit, I believe the previous owner dropped it and broke the screen. I have reasons to believe my screen is not authentic. It’s easily scratch. I notice small dent marks on the bottom & at the back of the phone. Battery health is 88% for mine which is sort of disappointing. Take note: -Phone is definitely used -Battery health is not within 90% -small dents -easily scratch on screen -it’s probably not water resistant anymore, if they actually replaced the screen. -no original cable or adapter Overall, it works fine. But I just want to put this out there so some of you will consider it before purchasing it. For the price is honestly ok.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived three day early. This phone is beautiful and flawless. Battery life is more than I expected. Phone works perfectly. I had to contact customer service through email and they responded to my questions immediately.
<<&&&&>>
When I read some of these reviews I was pretty worried after placing my order, but the phone came in perfect condition with 100% battery life. You would have never known it was refurbished. It does not come with a sim card but I just went to the AT&T store that day and got the phone activated. This is definitely the way to go instead of spending 2-300 dollars more on a brand new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Before purchasing the phone as a upgrade from my I phone 7 , I read all the reviews, then I made one of the the the biggest mistake of my life the phone is a total waste of time , everything is bad about the I phone x , considering it cost me so much money, I believe Amazon should monitor carefully the sale of used phone it's is obvious no one cares. I am certain the previous owner had problems and I brought it on myself, I am so dissatisfied.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition phone. Only bad part about this phone is it is a Japanese model phone certain things you can't do with them .acoording to some reports and testing It has a slower LTE modem, signal strength indoors was not as good .They are programmed a little different. A1902 is the exclusive edition for the Japan market. It covers some LTE bands used only in the country Notice that the phone has a mandatory shutter sound when taking photos.
<<&&&&>>
Package arrived on schedule. The iPhone was nicely packaged in an aftermarket carton. When I opened the package I was surprised at how perfect the cosmetic condition was. Awesome !! I placed the iPhone X on the enclosed charger and the phone was at 85%. It was 100% charged in about 15 minutes. I signed on and was able to transfer all data and apps automatically from my iPad. Overall, I am very pleased with the price, packaging and performance of the iPhone X. Great Phone !!
<<&&&&>>
The phone works perfectly fine, and honestly ended up exceeding expectations. Looking for a refurbished/renewed phone most times mean that you will have a kink or defect in the phone somewhere but not this one. The phone works great and honestly cant tell what’s supposed to be wrong with the phone. Had for 2 weeks and not a single problem. Would highly recommend buyerspray when ordering yours
<<&&&&>>
El equipo no funciona en Ecuador a pesar de que los comentarios responde que si funciona
<<&&&&>>
1) Works well. Worth the money. Great phone. High % battery life. Kept this phone. 2) Did not work. 80% battery life. Would not connect to Verizon. I sent this phone back for a full refund. The phone looked good and was functional in every way except the most important way... it could not make calls or use data, since it was unable to connect to any cellular network.
<<&&&&>>
The first phone I received was extremely scratched, had trouble making calls, and had poor battery life. The second phone I received worked well for a few weeks and now has serious screen issues. The screen is nonresponsive and does not light up when I touch it. While using the phone, it will randomly open and close various apps, act as though various points have been clicked, add words I never typed, etc. Major problems. I am very unhappy with this product.
<<&&&&>>
Awful!!, I was using the iPhone for less than 2 months and suddenly BLACKOUT during charging !!, no crash no nothing Inadmisible!!!!
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in good condition. I took it to the apple store for a complete inspection to which it passed. Apple would not insure through apple care, but I have assurian coverage through att. Some people mention scratches – mine had a small scratch, but I realize that the screen has a. glass cover which has a small scratch. This was really a great value!
<<&&&&>>
All the bells & whistles for half the price of a “new” one. Came with a screen protector on it & 98% battery health. Couldn’t have done better anywhere. Completely unlocked & ready to rock. FaceID works flawlessly & so did everything else- as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
I bought these as a C’mas gift. Will rate after they open them for C’mas.
<<&&&&>>
I have the iPhone se but wanted to update so I reviewed all the iPhones and found the ten to be the best for the price. After using it for a few months, I made the right choice. I love it and it pairs perfectly with my Apple Watch.
<<&&&&>>
Was unsure how a restored item would be. I've had it a month. Better than new. In perfect working and physical order. Battery lasts a looong time. Very happy. Sure beats $1000 for a brand new one!
<<&&&&>>
Renewed I Phone....had some very light small scratches but when put inside a protective case with a screen protector not noticeable at all. Works perfectly. Arrived with 94% battery capacity remaining.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is like brand new! I absolutely love it!!!
<<&&&&>>
We were a little skeptical about ordered a renewed phone, but this one was exquisite. Our granddaughter just loves it in every way.
<<&&&&>>
This is a great product.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was advertised as fully unlocked and i received a device that was GSM only, waited 5 days with no phone just to receive a device that wasn’t compatible with my network. Super disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
The battery life and performance were exceptional and exceeded expectations. Has been great on T-Mobile network
<<&&&&>>
Working good with all its features Bought it to be used in South America and no problems so far
<<&&&&>>
There was scratches and bad battery life
<<&&&&>>
Looks super new & works great. Saved $500 comparing if purchased new. I ordered a case & screen protector as well; everything arrived the same day. Happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Not good
<<&&&&>>
Works as it should. Love face time
<<&&&&>>
EVERYTHING WORKS AND LOOKS GREAT
<<&&&&>>
This item was returned.
<<&&&&>>
I would highly recommend this phone, this phone is amazing and awesome nothing bad to say about the sellers
<<&&&&>>
Does what it is supposed to
<<&&&&>>
I couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. It looked brand new and came with a pre installed glass screen protector. Battery was at 90% overall I’m super happy and satisfied with this purchase
<<&&&&>>
I like the product didn’t like the person who sold it to me
<<&&&&>>
Very Good
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone and a lot of space for apps
<<&&&&>>
Good value, good product and quick service. As advertised.
<<&&&&>>
The speaker is not working. And has scratches on the screen. Bad customer service
<<&&&&>>
el teléfono era tal cual lo compre! lo único malo es que el cargador y el cable son genéricos, el resto excelente!!!
<<&&&&>>
Back camera fuzzy
<<&&&&>>
Good condition, came with charger.
<<&&&&>>
Price is high as It didn’t have original charger. Also it doesn’t have ear phones at all.
<<&&&&>>
A++++
<<&&&&>>
I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the "10," as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a "B" for its design: 1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case. 2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily. 3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered. Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term. The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or "expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone." It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the "attention detection," meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the "notch." This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it. Even its flaws.
<<&&&&>>
tried this but went back to android
<<&&&&>>
I will want to buy this i phone but I am afraid, you recommend me to buy it what guarantee do I have if it comes out faulty after 3 months of use? I wonder why I do not live in USA I live in Ecuador
<<&&&&>>
I would like to try the product for free
<<&&&&>>
A bit pricey but worth it. Facial recognition works as password
<<&&&&>>
i was so scared to order a $600 8 plus off amazon and after reading some of the reviews it made me a lil more scared. i just got my phone in the mail today and it came in a nice little assorted box with a charger and everything. i took the phone out it already had a screen protector on so that was a plus, i cut it on and activated it with no problem, and so far it’s working perfectly fine, just like new. so far so great :) thank you buyspry or however u spell it lol ❤️
<<&&&&>>
This item wasn’t even a iPhone it’s a cheep android not the real iPhone 🤬
<<&&&&>>
Scratch every where.
<<&&&&>>
This is not what I asked for. I received the iPhone 8 Plus but it WAS NOT unlocked and on top of that, it said it was a Verizon phone. Come to find out out, it was an AT&T phone.
<<&&&&>>
I’m amazed with my purchase, even though that some of the reviews had me a little worried. I received the phone very quickly in less than 4 days to be exact. The conditions of the phone are amazing I can’t complain and the battery life is completely in good conditions. Some of the issues that worried me the most when i saw the reviews was battery life and scratches but once i got this it was completely in a good condition. (If i have any issues with the phone ill update my review)
<<&&&&>>
I love the look and feel of my new iPhone 8+. It came with a tempered glass packaged up great and no scratches on it. I was having a little problems with not being able to send a picture with my text. I contacted the seller and they send just send it back. But I took it to my carrier and I had forgot to turn on the data. Silly me! So now my phone works great with no problems at all.
<<&&&&>>
Everything is fine, it’s an unlocked phone that doesn’t have any real scratches or dings... but it also doesn’t have a new battery. Battery life said 82%. Guessing their cutoff is 80% for a battery replacement. If I have to bolt on the time and cost of the battery replacement, it’s not cheaper than Apple refurbished... which come with new batteries. Taking it to get a new battery tomorrow at the Apple Store... add on half a day and $100 to the cost. Meh, I’d be thrilled if this had a new battery but as it stands pretty underwhelmed. Phones should always come with new batteries.
<<&&&&>>
Absolutely new, just no earphones came in the box
<<&&&&>>
Paid 580.00 for the 8 Plus. Its trash. Its black with deep scratches in it (scratches are so deep on the phone that they appear sliver against the black phone making it look even worst). The Screen goes blank and phone re-starts every 2 mins. Then I realized the battery won charge. After leaving it on the charger for 5 plus hours it still read 1% charged. Complete garbage! Now, I have to put up a fight to get my money back...
<<&&&&>>
BEST DECISION EVER to buy this. Soooo happy i did AND got an awesome deal. Opened the box and was astounded by how brand new this was- not a scratch, not a ding, NOTHING. Even came with a glass screen protector! Kind of scared spending about $500 on something that I couldn’t see, touch, and feel but super happy I did. Consider this!!
<<&&&&>>
Mi hija está muy contenta con su Iphone 8 plus.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with defective screen. A simple quality control test would have found this before being shipped. Now I'm without a phone for a week while I await a replacement.
<<&&&&>>
Well. First phone sent has faulty speakers. Only works on Speaker. A real disappointment. Expecting replacement in a few days. I’ll let you know. Going to check if there’s any kind of warrantee... I’ve had Apple Care in the past. Can’t imagine anyone checking out this phone and not realizing the audio is not working. Kinda worrisome. May have to break down and spend the big bucks. We’ll see. 🧐
<<&&&&>>
I had a 6 plus phone and find this easier and more responsive than the 6. I am very happy with the 8 plus.
<<&&&&>>
I love everything about this phone from the price to its design it’s an amazing phone with a great price also don’t let a negative review change your thoughts on purchasing this device I received this phone in perfect condition i recently connected it to metro pcs an I’m glad I did I need an upgrade an I’m happy with this purchase I hope you enjoy ur new Iphone8 plus
<<&&&&>>
Great phone. Daughter loves it. Refabbed phone but works just like new. Tiny dings on screen fairly unnoticeable. Purchased screen protector and case to give it some lifetime with a teenager. Recommend
<<&&&&>>
I ordered iPhone 8 plus , it was good condition loke new, only this thing I don’t like it because I didn’t get earphone, original charging cable. I just returned same day. I am not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
I am sure purchasing anything refurbished/renewed would make anyone nervous. I am extremely pleased with this phone!!! It looks new, absolutely no scratches or any other imperfections!! Absolutely no issues with setting it up!
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone - would never know it was refurbished! Only negative would be the rinky-dink charger
<<&&&&>>
This phone is no good no earbuds no original charger Fri t camera is in the wrong this is fake and the top speaker/mic was packed with dirt dust really bad.....im.still waiting for my refund
<<&&&&>>
Very pleased!! Will be buying from this seller again when I buy my next upgrade (which will be very soon). Looks brand new. Easy set up with my phone carrier over the phone
<<&&&&>>
The phone worked great at first. After a week the fingerprint stopped working and the phone would die after a 6 hour shift when I wasn’t even on it. I guess that’s what I get for buying a used phone.
<<&&&&>>
Iphone 8plus advertised as FULLY unlock. It don't work with CDMA carriers. I am with Sprint and went to all the troubles to go to their Sprint Store and they showed me its only unlocked for GSM carriers. Grrrr!
<<&&&&>>
You can definitely tell it was used. Has a ring around apple logo where it had a case on it. Which if fine but the screen had two deep scratches and moderate scratches over entire screen surface. I powered it on but nothing else at this time. I am gifting and will update later.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered an 8 plus and received an 8 plus. Very happy with it. Came in great condition, looks like new. Had my new Otter Box cover for an 8 plus ready. Verizon took care of changing it over and all the details. SPRY delivered as advertised. Missie
<<&&&&>>
The microphone is messed up can’t fave time because no one can hear me very disappointed in this product. Better off buying new to avoid these hassles
<<&&&&>>
I was nervous to buy a phone online but I’m glad I went through this company. I haven’t had any issues and I bought the iPhone in March. No issues and phone came on time.
<<&&&&>>
I went to apple customer service and as the warranty given by the seller was a 90-day warranty, the iphone could not be replaced. I used the iphone just for 4 months.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is NOT UNLOCKED as advertised. Boost will not be able to turn on service because the miei number doesn’t work. Don't waste your time with this.
<<&&&&>>
I rated this item a 9.5. It didn’t come with headphones but it doesn’t really matter to me. I just wanted the phone. But overall this phone is amazing with a reasonable price with amazing battery life. I was a little hesitant at first but it was worth it and I’m glad I did.
<<&&&&>>
Would not hold a charge and would turn on and off repeatedly. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I couldn’t give it zero stars.
<<&&&&>>
Firstly I received a 7 plus instead of the 8 plus and the home button does not work like WTF!!!
<<&&&&>>
Phone is just like brand new and in perfect condition but it doesn’t come with original charger or headphones. Overall the phone is amazing.
<<&&&&>>
So far works great, arrived early.. hooked up to US Cellular with no issues. Keep your receipt though because the manager at the store was rude about it because we live in a bigger town with more crimes and was werry about hooking it up until the receipt was presented.
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono está más o menos, el teléfono viene en buen estado, solo que venía un poco sucio, pues se nota que no lo limpiaron antes de enviarlo. Y el teléfono enciende normal, solo que la batería está a un 87% maximo, y cuando me deslizó por la pantalla se traba, pensé que era normal por como configure el teléfono y pues lo resetie varias veces y da igual lo que haga o como lo configure, siempre se traba y pues supe es que es un problema de pantalla.
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone for it to be defective. I returned it for an exchange & received a refund of half of my purchase price. Wanted to like the phone. It worked well the first day. Lost the device, lost money, & would definitely not recommend this place for your purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I was so skeptical on buying the phone at first because it was refurbished but when I did an it came the phone was like brand new and it came with a charger, the camera and everything else was fully functional also it was fully unlocked, im so excited. thank you BREED
<<&&&&>>
The charger that came with the phone was not apple verified and it didn’t work after a month. The phone also has some minor dents and the color was peeling off on the bottom and that was disappointing. Other than that, the phone worked well.
<<&&&&>>
it did have just a few scuffs but wasn’t visible unless lookin hard as i do.. overall it great...
<<&&&&>>
A quality product that excels the apple product line, cool smooth It's 12, a charing glass, 5.5in full touchscreen and not a lousy .looking notch in between the full screen display. The A8 bionic Cpu offers lightening quick usage. Beautiful touch screen, gorgeous camera with visual effectsto die for and a security proven thumbprint lock technology.
<<&&&&>>
so far we have not encountered any of the negative issues people talked about in their reviews. We were a little hesitant to go the refurbished route but this far we are very happy with the outcome! Phone looked perfect out of the package.
<<&&&&>>
Arrived on time. No damage noted. Worked as expected. No problems noted so far.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is like new--no scratches. The battery capacity was at 87%. Very happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Like new, perfect condition
<<&&&&>>
The Bluetooth doesn’t work well. It was some glue on the top left corner which shows it is probably opened for repair. There was no dent On it and it works well, except the Bluetooth
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Too heavy and battery did not perform as advertised
<<&&&&>>
Work fast
<<&&&&>>
The phone froze up on a regular basis.
<<&&&&>>
Like new, no issues or complaints
<<&&&&>>
AAA+++
<<&&&&>>
It has obvious screen damage which affects aesthetics and usage. Returning for a full refund. I'll just buy from Apple.
<<&&&&>>
No me llego mi articulo
<<&&&&>>
It's in Perfect conditions like new!
<<&&&&>>
it is good
<<&&&&>>
It’s a good value, mine had quite a scratched up screen. But for 200$ less than retail I’m very happy! I’m going to go get the screen fixed for 30$ and it’s all good!
<<&&&&>>
Hola buenos dias, hoy mi teléfono phone se quedo prendido y no quiere a pagar se a calentado de masiado. No reponde al control de mando para apagarlo se reinisia solo una y otrabe. A manecio loco... Att un cliente de amazon....

Nothing not to like ...looked at other sites with renewed phones read reviews ,most looked like a crap shoot when ordering the phone . Than I found the Verizon site, everything was A+,l bought the phone very Happy.
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono es muy importante
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone 📲 8Plus get the job ✅ done.
<<&&&&>>
Thank you
<<&&&&>>
It came with no scratches and with a screen protector and a charger working in a perfect way. Though it didn't come in it's original box but doesn't matter. Phone's perfect.
<<&&&&>>
Nice, what I needed and wanted, a great gift to myself.
<<&&&&>>
The battery isn’t good
<<&&&&>>
Very impressive Honestly when i bought the phone I was so nervous because of the pricing but totally worth the money I spent . Perfect condition, it hontesly looks so new . And I love it
<<&&&&>>
This item I was deceived in buying doesnt work good at all and the seller isnt truthful at all. Terrible. Beware of this seller please.
<<&&&&>>
I had ordered unlocked phone, but I got a locked phone, that would not work with T-Mobile sim card and I returned the phone.
<<&&&&>>
I kinda like the 8plus, but I wanted to purchase x iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
My phone was shipped to me 1 Day earlier than expected. Packaging was good enough for me and the phone was 10/10 no signs of use at all. And it connected to my tracphone network no problem.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had it for 3 months now and I haven’t had a single issue yet with it. It functions as it’s needed and it also look really sleek.
<<&&&&>>
I highley reconmend this seller. Very fast shipping it came before the estimated time. Very good phone and works will all carriers
<<&&&&>>
Had 3 small deep scratches
<<&&&&>>
It came with a charger and I haven’t had any problems with the phone. It looks so brand new !! I thought it wasn’t refurbished for a second.
<<&&&&>>
Dislike how it wasn’t told to me or noted that the phone was punctured when receiving it.
<<&&&&>>
Quick and flawless delivery and product very happy!
<<&&&&>>
Price
<<&&&&>>
Looked brand new and acted brand new! Love it!!!

<<&&&&>>
Only had phone 3 days. Haven’t had any issue to date
<<&&&&>>
Excelente estado, sin detalles. Solamente la batería estaba al 89% y el cargador de muy baja calidad
<<&&&&>>
It’s okay. Not bad , but not that good condition, as I was expecting from text.
<<&&&&>>
I liked everything about the phone. I used it for all purposes.
<<&&&&>>
I like it very much
<<&&&&>>
Everything I expected

Excelente estado y desbloqueado internacionalmente

All unlocked iphone 8 plus 64 g are 699 at apple. Brand new and not refurbished. Is there something different with this phone? Curious. Thanks
<<&&&&>>
This phone looks like new and works great .
<<&&&&>>
Very disappointed that the phone description did NOT mention that the SIM card did not come with the phone. If that was indicated I would've purchase the phone, and the price should reflect NO SIM card.
<<&&&&>>
I am not at all happy with this phone, its glitchy it’s the worst phone I have had yet will go with Samsung note next time
<<&&&&>>
The delivery took longer than advertised, but the product is perfect.
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in the mail 2 days late but I don’t think that was the sellers fault - other than that I’m very happy with my purchase! You can’t beat the price. There’s just one little scuff on the right bottom edge but other than that this refurbished phone seems brand new. The phone came completely dead but I don’t really mind that I just charged it - the battery life came at 92% I can’t complain! I think it’s definitely worth buying a refurbished phone over a new one if you’re looking to save money. I felt mostly safe buying this because of the 90 day warranty Amazon Renewed promised. The camera works well I can’t find anything wrong with it so far - if I do I will update my review. Thanks CR Land!
<<&&&&>>
Cannot say enough GOOD things about the phone I received from reseller TradeMore. They had fabulous communication with me when I needed to adjust the shipping method. There’s one small scuff on the top of my screen, not on the display itself. Otherwise the phone is 100% perfect. The battery life is better than any cellphone I’ve had in recent memory and came with 98% battery health. That's a big deal for someone debating on if they should buy the much more expensive Xr model of iPhone!!! Couldn't be more pleased with my purchase from them.
<<&&&&>>
I had to replace my phone due to a screen issue. This was a fantastic replace. Phone looks and functions as new. My only issue was the battery health came at 87% and the only accessory, the charger it came with was flimsy but I have another from my previous phone.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone works perfect. It was a gift to my older brother who is going blind and he says he can change settings and see it perfectly. The only issue is battery life but I think that’s an issue on most phones.
<<&&&&>>
Arrived on time and unharmed. Brand new iPhone with no problems whatsoever. Would buy from this buyer again.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is perfect, not even a scratch. I ordered over a three day weekend and got it on a Wednesday morning. I'm really impressed!
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with this purchase. $575 refurbished vs. $800 new. Used the difference to buy an iPad!
<<&&&&>>
Bought it as a gift for a friend. She loves it!
<<&&&&>>
Was a bit nervous about buying a used phone off amazon. Extremely happy with my purchase. It’s basically a new phone. Not a single scratch anywhere. Only complaint is that the battery life is at 88% but still a lot better than my awful iPhone 7.
<<&&&&>>
The only issue I had with this purchase was the delay. Everything that was promised I received and was in great working condition. No nicks, cracks or breakage.
<<&&&&>>
At first it was giving my daughter a hard time but now that it’s fully set up it’s doing well
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
It has all the bells and whistles I need!
<<&&&&>>
It works perfectly well!
<<&&&&>>
Brought this iPhone 8 Plus for 700.00 ,it locked could not get any provider to unlocked phone,tried to send it back after 4 months My wit will not exchange the phone,very disappointed,700.00 is a lot of money to waste,a phone you can not use. Apple store stated to replace will be 399.00.
<<&&&&>>
The camera doesn’t work, neither does the flash light. This has been a problem since unpacking the item. Eventually, both would work after resetting and restoring my iPhone but would then stop after a few days. I have dealt with this issue for over a month. Initially, I tried calling the seller multiple times and have left a voice message. Never heard from them. So I am now stuck with a faulty phone that works on its own terms. The seller was Lonestar Mobile.
<<&&&&>>
Leason learned with this one. I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it. After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help. She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen. When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone. She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved. Don't do it. It's not worth it. Just get a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.
<<&&&&>>
Package arrived on time. But the phone was not unlocked as advertised
<<&&&&>>
after I used this phone, it have some problems.it will automatically restart when I use it,especially charging.i was scared,because i have no extra money to change another phone.i was bothered by this problem.
<<&&&&>>
I should be able to give zero stars. This is a scam. The phone I got is faulty and the charger never worked. I have to spend money to get it fixed and I have to buy a charger. I am reluctant to spend money to get it fixed because it might still not work. I am stuck with a useless piece of crap.
<<&&&&>>
The screen was too dark even with brightness at 100% the screen didnt look the way is supposed to
<<&&&&>>
COMPRE UN IPHONE 8 DE 256 GB TAL COMO ESTA EN LA PUBLICACION Y EN EL RECIBO DE COMPRA Y ASI ME LO COBRO. PERO CUANDO ME LO MANDO ERA UN IPHONE 8 DE 64 GB, CUYO VALOR OBVIAMENTE ES MENOR. ES UN PESIMO VENDEDOR, UN ESTAFADOR... TENGAN CUIDADO SI ALGO DE DECENCIA LE QUEDA QUE ME DEVUELVA EL VALOR DE LA DIFERENCIA.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and I try to contact the company but no response, I contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back, i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back (I Was waiting a day because I wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one) I would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money. I contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return, suggesting I take it to a "repair shop" and have them look at it. It freezes constantly and the volume doesn't work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation.
<<&&&&>>
Was told by Customer Service there was no way to unlock the phone and that it was GSM unlocked as stated. I contacted Apple who checked the number and found it was still registered to AT&T. I logged in and unlocked it from AT&T but this was not GSM unlocked. It was an AT&T phone. Hope the phone works better than Jem Jem's indifferent customer service.

I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.
<<&&&&>>
Package arrived on time. But the phone was not unlocked as advertised
<<&&&&>>
after I used this phone, it have some problems.it will automatically restart when I use it,especially charging.i was scared,because i have no extra money to change another phone.i was bothered by this problem.
<<&&&&>>
I should be able to give zero stars. This is a scam. The phone I got is faulty and the charger never worked. I have to spend money to get it fixed and I have to buy a charger. I am reluctant to spend money to get it fixed because it might still not work. I am stuck with a useless piece of crap.
<<&&&&>>
The screen was too dark even with brightness at 100% the screen didnt look the way is supposed to
<<&&&&>>
COMPRE UN IPHONE 8 DE 256 GB TAL COMO ESTA EN LA PUBLICACION Y EN EL RECIBO DE COMPRA Y ASI ME LO COBRO. PERO CUANDO ME LO MANDO ERA UN IPHONE 8 DE 64 GB, CUYO VALOR OBVIAMENTE ES MENOR. ES UN PESIMO VENDEDOR, UN ESTAFADOR... TENGAN CUIDADO SI ALGO DE DECENCIA LE QUEDA QUE ME DEVUELVA EL VALOR DE LA DIFERENCIA.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and I try to contact the company but no response, I contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back, i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back (I Was waiting a day because I wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one) I would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money. I contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return, suggesting I take it to a "repair shop" and have them look at it. It freezes constantly and the volume doesn't work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation.
<<&&&&>>
Was told by Customer Service there was no way to unlock the phone and that it was GSM unlocked as stated. I contacted Apple who checked the number and found it was still registered to AT&T. I logged in and unlocked it from AT&T but this was not GSM unlocked. It was an AT&T phone. Hope the phone works better than Jem Jem's indifferent customer service.
<<&&&&>>
The whole side of the phone is cracked and is obviously in bad condition, I do not recommend this to anyone.
<<&&&&>>
The current phone I had was destroyed and I decided to order a i8 phone rose gold unlocked, when I ordered it, I received a i7 phone white 😕, seeing that I needed a phone I decided to keep it and use it but then is was locked , I followed all the instructions that came with the phone which specifically said that the phone is unlocked, but the phone is LOCKED.....the reason I’m writing this review so late is because i have a friend that unlock phones and trying to unlock phones takes time, he unlocks the most difficult networks and this phone just can’t unlock , I’m going to return it. I’m very very disappointed 😡😡😡😡
<<&&&&>>
Ignore all the bad reviews ! I got my IPhone 8 Gold in the mail this afternoon and it was dent & scratch free. When I went into setting the battery storage is 100% and the battery life is great! It even came with an apple charger & and apple wall box. No dongle though. Amazing purchase, I’m so glad I bought it!
<<&&&&>>
It is almost perfect... It takes a while to fully charge, but the battery lasts all day long, esthetically flawless.. not a single scratch.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was great I was a little worried because of the reviews but when i received the phone, it was great. The glass at the back is completely intact, there is 2 small scratches at the front that you can barely even see. The battery life was at 98% so this was an awesome deal for the money. Definitely worth buying
<<&&&&>>
The phone literally cut off & on On me like 10 times also the call will drop and says called failed. It’s nice and new but the phone system seems to have its own issues
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in great condition but I have one small problem. I had an android from metropcs before this iphone and I tried putting the Sim in this phone but it says "no sim" and wont make calls. I saw another review on here that said it works with metro pcs so I'm trying to figure out the problem.
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone 8 have a problem, first it took me 6 hours to charge the phone before turn on. I put a chip and Apple ID than turn back off , I don’t want to deal with it no more. Please return my money
<<&&&&>>
A month after it working perfectly fine, the system just crashed. I have returned it and I'm waiting for next is my refund.
<<&&&&>>
Although I got the wrong size, (I thought that I had ordered the Plus size), it is a good product overall.
<<&&&&>>
The iphone 8 came in a great case. At first i was impressed. After switching over my data, I discovered 2 major flaws with the phone. 1) Camera hardware malfunction. Not fixable. 2) Battery life was about 3 hours on a FULL charge. I decided to return it only to find out i had to pay the shipping. All in, waste of time and $10.00 loss in shipping back to the seller.
<<&&&&>>
This is the best! My son loved it he was so happy about it! There is no scratches, No dents no nothing. It doesn't look refurbished it looks bran new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to buy a phone. Doesn't come with original charger cube but not really affecting how it charges. It charges really fast and runs out really slowly. Price is astonishing.
<<&&&&>>
I was trepidatious to make this purchase because there’s no way to tell the quality of the phone before you get it, but I risked it and got the biscuit. The phone I recieved was absolutely perfect.
<<&&&&>>
A little on the pricey side but it is a great phone easy to use and add or remove apps I like it. I would suggest it to others looking for a great phone.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent
<<&&&&>>
The product have lot of scratch and it not worth money
<<&&&&>>
Love the iPhone so far.
<<&&&&>>
I’m happy with the phone I ordered, however, the phone is actually rose gold not gold as the description states.
<<&&&&>>
loses the signal and turns off alone, so you can not use the phone, I do not recommend
<<&&&&>>
Mint condition sans 1 minor blemish on the lower left corner (which is now covered up by my phone case)! I have Metro by T-Mobile (i.e. Metro PCS) and had no trouble activating/using this phone immediately!! (:
<<&&&&>>
I ordered a Rose Gold iPhone 8. Phone arrived in perfect condition, exactly as advertised!
<<&&&&>>
better than expected
<<&&&&>>
My new iPhone has glitches where it blacks the screen and all the buttons are useless. It happens randomly I tried restarting and restoring with my computer. But nothing I can fix anything you suggest?
<<&&&&>>
The phone looked brand new but I returned it because I don’t need it anymore
<<&&&&>>
It’s good
<<&&&&>>
Buen producto
<<&&&&>>
Better than the iPhone 6s for sure lol
<<&&&&>>
Al principio todo bien, pero la batería no me sirve se me descarga muy rápido, algo que no es común en los iPhone
<<&&&&>>
I really do like my phone. Great deal. Thankyou Amazon.
<<&&&&>>
It works perfectly.
<<&&&&>>
Calls and research
<<&&&&>>
Very nice, looks almost brand new.. battery capacity is however 87%,nice phone tho.
<<&&&&>>
It's my cell phone. I love my new phone!!!
<<&&&&>>
It ok for short term use
<<&&&&>>
This phone is great
<<&&&&>>
item meet my expectations
<<&&&&>>
nice buy for the price !
<<&&&&>>
Good quality.
<<&&&&>>
Completely disappointed. Listing said it was an UNLOCKED phone for AT&T and T-mobile. I popped in my T-mobile SIM card and it didn’t work. It said the “SIM Not Supported“. I thought I was doing something wrong so I called apple. Went through the troubleshooting steps and still nothing. Then I paid to see if the phone was locked by using the IMEI. Sure enough the phone was locked on AT&T. I don’t recommend buying from this listing. Was going to be a Christmas present, so I’m glad I tested it first.
<<&&&&>>
I just received mine. Perfect condition. Tested camera, touchscreen and making a phone-call, everything works. If something goes wrong I'll update this
<<&&&&>>
This is my first iPhone, and I have to say I am impressed. The price was reasonable and looks, feels, and performs great
<<&&&&>>
Well I expected, at last, a phone in a box...
<<&&&&>>
Hasta la fecha todo bien
<<&&&&>>
:)
<<&&&&>>
Bought this phone 5 months ago for my mom and so far it’s been working really well! No complaints. Battery life is great, and the phone took the SIM card with no issue.
<<&&&&>>
It arrived as expected and was in mint condition. I am very pleased.
<<&&&&>>
Works as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
This review is for the phone, but considering how it was bought from this Amazon seller. I was a bit weary to buy, given the varying reviews. It arrived in a white, unmarked box as expected as a renewed/refurbished product. Came with an offbrand charger, but no headphones. The description said, by definition, it would have minimal to no scratches. There is one 3/8” to 1/2” scratch near the front camera on the screen that goes into the functional screen area. It’s not terrible, but I would consider it a little more severe than minimal. Battery health was said to be about 80% if I remember correctly. Battery health as received was 96%, which I was happy about. Everything else, a few days in, seem to be on par with a new phone. I will update this review with any shortfalls or unanticipted failures going forward.
<<&&&&>>
Super disappointed when I got this phone. I rarely leave reviews but when I opened this phone I was aggravated. Screen has scratches and the outside edges of the phone are dirty. This is clearly not a refurbished phone, so it should not be advertised as such. Now I have to wait for another one which is even more aggravating!
<<&&&&>>
Comes with very visible scratches at the front and the sides. As much as I hate to write a negative review, but I had no choice. Had ordered this for my brother on his birthday expecting it to at least have some minor scratches, but got to see it is full of scratches on the front and sides, I've bought renewed phones before but never faced a situation like this. Very dissatisfied.
<<&&&&>>
This IPhone X has been phenomenal. The speed at which it operates is Incredible. If you are questioning this buy, don’t. It’s a wonderful deal. I’ve not had one issue thus far, and will most certainly update this review if I have one within the warranty period. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen and a good case—this phone is glass front and back.
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone X was delivered in what I believe to be near perfect condition. Very light scratch on the face of the screen, however it disappeared after installing a tempered glass screen protector. Powered on just fine and is fully compatible with my at&t SIM card. The iPhone came with 89% of it’s original factory battery health which is more than advertised for this refurbished product (battery health can be found in settings). With the iPhone X I also received both an apple brand power cable and wall adapter (I got lucky). My apple AirPods and apple watch (both sold separately) paired to this devise without any issues. Overall: I received my product exactly as advertised which makes me very satisfied. Other reviewers complain about things outside of the sellers control such as the lack of a headphone jack and the new gesture controls used in place of the retired “home button”. The learning curve felt easy and natural. Potential buyers should look into the features of the phone before buying this product new OR refurbished. 5/5 stars highly recommended.
<<&&&&>>
This is a refurbished iPhone X. The box is from Verizon company that comes with only the charger and the phone. Doesn’t have a pin to eject the SIM card nor earphones. The screen is a bit scratched but that’s to be expected since it’s refurbished. The box also said that it’s a pre owned. So the assumption is that someone turned in the phone for an upgrade. The battery health is at 99%. Today is the first day I’m using it so don’t really know how long the battery will last me. I ordered a screen protector so maybe that’ll blocker the scratch a bit. We shall see. Overall, it’s a cheap iPhone X with 256 GB. I have T-Mobile and the SIM card works. Not a bad deal at all.
<<&&&&>>
I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream. Only minor inconvenience was having to update the phone before I could download the backup from my old phone. Came fully unlocked as promised and with an off brand charger that works fine.
<<&&&&>>
Forget buying new phones. Just buy refurbished phones. It’s better for the environment and it’s a better value.
<<&&&&>>
I picked 2 day shipping to get it delivered 5 days later. Upon receiving I tried to power it on. To no response. I went to charge it on the charger that was given to get the charging screen for 30 minutes. I then used my other charger for 4 hours to no results. The quality of charger and charger brick was very poor. Did not come with EarPods. I sent it back Now I hope I get my refund quickly for amazon guarantee.
<<&&&&>>
LOVE! THOUSAND TIMES LOVE! I was skeptical at first when selecting to buy this iPhone, I took time into reading all the comments and seeing as there was more positive reviews then negatives I went ahead and bought it. The entire phone is in BRAND NEW condition, no scratches or blemishes! The battery life was said to be 80% mine on this phone is 99% maximum capacity! I am very pleased with how well this turned out to be! I did however not rate the fingerprint ID because it is facial ID not fingerprint. I do recommend trying not to go through FedEx as they are crap.
<<&&&&>>
Would give 0 stars if I could. I received the phone today and have already contacted the seller. The phone was NOT UNLOCKED like the product advertised. I have spent extra money with my career to activate it only to find it locked. For now I will wait and see. I do not recommend even spending your money with a company that cannot guarantee what it advertises.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this refurbished iPhone with high hopes. It looked great and the screen was in perfect condition. I soon realized that the Bluetooth did not work with all my Bluetooth devices. I could not get the phone to pair with my car or headphones. The phone also didn’t work when I tried using the adapter and headphones with a cord. I returned the phone for a full refund.
<<&&&&>>
Product came with the following: iPhone X 64 gb Was unlocked & works great. Battery life 97% Basic charger & block As expected: NO iPhone accessories NO headphones or dongle No iPhone box The phone is currently working smoothly and updated IOS 13.2, meaning that it’s not a fake. Check: IMEI # IOS iCloud Apple ID *UPDATE* November 20th. 17 DAYS LATER Phone is still working with no issues *UPDATE* December 19th. Phone is still working with no issues. No battery, screen, updates, IOS issues.
<<&&&&>>
Won't connect with my Bose wireless speakers, and won't connect with my wireless JBL speakers. Internet search shows many people have similar problems. The iPhone X has serious issues with bluetoothing. Wish I hadn't bought it. Another problem is that the music app randomly malfunctions. I click on a playlist for it to play and instead get a menu of things to do such as deleting the playlist. Why? Is some saboteur active inside Apple? I've not used anything but iPhones since the first one came out, but this sort of deliberate aggravation of customers is getting too much.
<<&&&&>>
I am happy that I found an unlocked iPhone X. The price was decent. I can’t say I’m in love with it bc it’s more difficult that the iPhone 6 I had. Getting used to no home button or headphone jack is a bummer.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased two devices. I was unable to activate either on Sprint. I called BUY Spry and the agent told me, "sometimes Sprint just doesn't work" I searched the IMEI on IMEI.info and found two things: One was the correct model per description - A1865. However, this phone is LOCKED to a carrier! The other device was the wrong model - A1901. This model is GSM network only. That's an epic FAIL for BuySpry, especially since they blamed Sprint. I won't buy refurbished again. These are both getting sent back.
<<&&&&>>
Nice product, looks like new. Battery life is not 100%, I would say around 60... but overall, I satisfied with the purchase
<<&&&&>>
Do not expect "certified refurbished" products you order from Trademore to last very long. On Jan. 22 of this year, I ordered an iPhoneX, 256 GB. It arrived in good shape, with a small scratch on the screen, but otherwise functioning fine. After 5 months of gentle use (never dropped, expensive protective case, never wet, etc.) it completely died on the charger overnight. When I contacted Trademore, they said after 90 days, there's nothing they can do. They made no offer to troubleshoot. We've taken it to a repair shop and found out the processor had gone bad. We're spending almost as much as a brand new phone now, which I wish I'd done in the first place (which would have given us the Apple guarantee).
<<&&&&>>
The phone i was told by an Apple employee should of never been put on the market. What a disaster purchase! The phone will never work. I now have to wait days for return instructions and a refund. What a mess! I will never use Amazon again!
<<&&&&>>
Received it in mail about 2 hours ago, the box/envelope that the item was shipped in looked normal and didn't look damaged however when I opened it the screen had 2 small cracks on the corners. Didn't even try to turn it on. I am returning it to the seller. Maybe it happened during shipment but I rather pay a bit extra and have a fully working iPhone with no cracked screen. Please see picture for detail.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone like a month ago. It delivered about a week after scheduled delivery. It was okay, until I opened the package. The box inside was already open and plastic wrapping around the phone was already teared up. It was still okay, until I tried to use the phone. It didn’t switch on. I tried to charge the phone with the charger supplied, tried my other original charger, and tried wireless charging too. It didn’t charge, and it never switched on. I returned the phone the day after. Don’t but this !
<<&&&&>>
This iPhone was worth every dollar! I was a bit unsure if I wanted to order this phone due to the bad reviews of them receiving very used and scratched phones. But I decided to take my chances and order it. AND I AM SO HAPPY I DID ! My mom and I actually ordered this same phone for ourselves. My phone was in perfect condition. No scratch of any kind. However, the side of my mom’s phone did come with very minor scratches by the SIM slot. Nothing major or visible. Easily concealed with a phone case. Unsure if this was the seller’s doing or the phones already had it before refurbishing it, but our phones arrived with already having a tempered glass screen protector not only on the screen, but also on the camera ! Ordered a pack of screen protectors prior to ordering the phones, but now I have a new pack for the future.
<<&&&&>>
Long reviews say this phone is amazing and some say it is horrible so I’ll give you a quick review based on my experience and no I wasn’t paid for this. When I was looking for a phone to buy the comments sketched me out and the fact that it was refurbished didn’t help, but the phone came literally with no scratches, it read my chip at first try and it runs beautifully. Maybe I was lucky but I am really satisfied
<<&&&&>>
Dont ever try this product or even deal with this seller .. the IPHONE X faceID didnt work ... and after contacting my apple maintenance shop they confirmed that it can't be fixed ... After a long thread of emails I've returned the IPHONE with a partial refund! They didnt accept to make a full refund! I even paid the return shipping fees .. Dont even think about it .. i wasted my money on this ...
<<&&&&>>
SO FAR SO GOOD. Totally worth my money. I mean like it looks brand new but I had to give it a couple days to see if there were any minor technicalities that we're going to appear. And there was some, It started glitching on face time and my whole screen would freeze and I wouldn't be able to press or do anything. I had to hang up on the press because I held the power button then my phone started working again. Weird. But I've only had the phone for 2 days so I'll come back and write another report after a month, but the phone is totally worth my money besides the minor glitch. (part 1)
<<&&&&>>
Got mine from NETWORKSTORE and so far its been working good. Had a few times where it froze and had to do a forced shut down but I don't know that this is due to being a renewed device. Other than that, and it has been a while since it ast did it, I have yet to have it looked at, it has functioned fine and is very user friendly. The OLED screen is almost as clear in direct daylight as indoors. Battery health was 88% and cosmetically the phone was new. Quite satisfied with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I was nervous to by a refurbished phone, but I’m impressed so far! The only bad part is there are scratches on the screen and around the frame of the glass. I suppose that’s what you get when you buy used. I instantly took it to verizon to have liquid glass installed for $50 and they noticed the scratches not me. Battery life is 100% and everything seems to be working great!
<<&&&&>>
You can see tons of scratches when light shines on the screen. The phone I got was definitely dropped, scuffed, and just blatantly abused! The seller cleaned the screen, but failed to clean the speakers, and charger port. A brand new phone is only $100 more. I would suggest just buying a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Loved everything about this deal. Got a fraction of the cost of a brand new iPhone, comes with a cheaper protection plan with the same coverage as AppleCare, and it came out of the box like new with a charger. The back was has a glossy finish with 0 blemishes and the screen had VERY minor wear, pretty much brand new. Would buy from them again and again
<<&&&&>>
Was very skeptical about buying a renewed phone. Amazon had already screwed me once before. but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this phone. No scratches on the screen or back case. Some light ones on the edges of the phone near the charging port. 91% battery capacity still. Was very satisfied and ordered another one for my partner since she is still using an iPhone 6s.
<<&&&&>>
This product is magical ! It is brand new not a scratch on it ! Battery life was 96% and it included a charger and accessories ! Amazing like gong to the Apple store but cheaper ! Full disclosure: the seller provided a note indicating that I would receive compensation for this perfect review in the form of an Amazon gift card . This did not change my review
<<&&&&>>
I received the phone and it was spotless. I may have gotten lucky and ended up with one that was purchased new and returned right away, I'm not sure, just sharing my experience. Battery health was 100% and there was not a scratch on it, seemed brand new. Very happy.
<<&&&&>>
Like everyone else, I was weary to purchase a renewed iPhone here. However, I'm happy to say that the phone I received seems to be in great condition. It looks almost new (besides a couple very tiny unnoticeable scratches on the screen), and has been working great so far. The only thing is: the shipping journey was awful. This was shipped by USPS, and they temporarily lost my package for a few days, and I had to call several numbers to figure out where it went. I finally received it 4 days after the estimated delivery given by USPS. Avoid USPS if possible!
<<&&&&>>
Got this iPhone today. Everything works flawless except for the fact that I cannot connect any of my bluetooth devices... sad.
<<&&&&>>
Todo muy bien, venía como nuevo solo sin su caja y los accesorios son genéricos (solo un golpe pequeño en una esquina que no se nota casi )
<<&&&&>>
1. Has notable scratches on the back and the sides. Infact a sticker on the box says "bad back and body" !!. 2. Battery health is at 93% which is not great but ok I guess.However while charging touch screen goes nuts and can't use the touch screen properly ! And also if i try to use the phone while charging the battery level drops (while charging) as well ! Hence i'm pretty sure this has a bad battery.3 The charging cable / charger I got with the device is not from apple and the cable doesn't even work.. 4 The phone gets super hot within like 5 mins after light use... Overall I'd say not to purchase this. It's not worth the money and it's not "refurbished" for sure.. These are used devices with defects
<<&&&&>>
Pues me agrado la entrega rápida pero la presentación no me agrado tanto ojalá me sea útil porque solo trae 85% de batería y tiene algunas señales de uso
<<&&&&>>
I have bought Amazon refurb products before and have never been disappointed. I have had this phone for several months now and have had "0" issues and got it at a great price.
<<&&&&>>
You Just have to call customer service and give them your IMEI # to activate the phone with your sims card
<<&&&&>>
Everything going pretty good and was making an unboxing video being revisited after phone arrived & wife ask me to listen to phone call and see what I thought of earpiece speaker quality at which time I did and there is definitely not up to Her Apple 6s quality let alone a newer model phone? In negotiations now for exchange? Will keep U apprised.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this phone not expecting too much, but it came with many surprises. 1. This phone arrived extremely fast. I don't have prime, and it still arrived in 3 days. Huge plus!! 2. The screen and body had minimal scratches. The paint was a bit scratched on the charging port, and there was a few very tiny scratches on the notch, but not on the screen or body itself. Very good. My only problem is the battery health on this phone it came at 88% That is not too bad, but I would still prefer something higher. I ordered a replacement and I requested that I would prefer something that is 95% or higher. They seemed very understanding, so we will see what will happen. Other than that AMAZING PHONE!!!
<<&&&&>>
I received this phone with scratches to the side bezel and back glass. Pretty deep scratches at that. Phone also had 80% overall battery life remaining, which I understand it is mentioned in the description but it still shouldn’t cut that close. Overall the phone is working well. For the amount of money you spend on this device, spend the extra and buy new. I’m very disappointed in the quality.
<<&&&&>>
I don’t know if the phone was supposed to came with the headphones but I didn’t receive it on the box
<<&&&&>>
Very disappointed in the product that I received. The screen appears to be a cheap aftermarket screen that has lines running through it at low brightness. Would not recommend using trademore if you want a quality device.
<<&&&&>>
I read reviews before buying. Only two days in will update if anything changes. Luckily for me I had no issues. Order arrived next day no cracks at all. very small mark near charging port not a big deal. Phone comes with screen protector on it. I got 100% battery life on mine - checked under settings.
<<&&&&>>
Bought phone in April for $719 - stopped working in November- never but a ”renewed” phone!
<<&&&&>>
Phone was great and amazing, until I tried playing music and only one of the speakers (barely) works - and the sound is horrible. Very sad as I’ve always bought refurbished phones and never had any issues, until now. This is a first and I’m very sad with the outcome of this phone. Currently trying to get in contact with seller, but so far, no response :(
<<&&&&>>
Claro que si me gusta mucho esta muy bonito
<<&&&&>>
this phone has been a huge headache for me, I should have just bought a new phone, and so should you. The battery came below 80% capacity and is severely damaged, now I have to spend an additional $100 just to get it fixed. The phone keeps shutting down randomly and is most likely because this company switches out original parts in the phone with cheaper parts
<<&&&&>>
Great to be back to iPhone. Delivered on time and functions well. Needed assistance from Apple store for data transfer, but since I bought here, they would not help. Put me on to an app that did not transfer all data. Still trying to get photos downloaded to phone.
<<&&&&>>
I bough this product last month ago, and suddenly the screen become black out. I tried to charge it again but the screen doesnt work at all. I was so dis appointed in the iPhone x that They send to me it works from the beginning but They ends like this. Wish that the next iPhone x that They Will send me is 100% in good condition.
<<&&&&>>
Great product, i using it now to type this up. But only bad thing is a few scratches on the sides, if it came with headphones and was like $50 cheaper i would totally recommend, but it is refurbished so don’t expect alot of greatness.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone two days ago. It was time for an upgrade from my iPhone 6. Anyway long story short the speakers are blown. It was working fine for about a day or so. And just stopped working. I’m not going to bitc* and moan about it not working. Cuz in life sh*t happens. I’m going to go get it fixed tomorrow at an Apple store. Just a heads up for anyone buying this product there’s probably going to be a good chance something won’t work to tip top condition. But hey, that’s what you get for buying a refurbished phone
<<&&&&>>
The best decision I’ve made buying a phone. Phone is in PERFECT condition. Battery condition is at 98%! Best value for the price, much cheaper than buying a new phone directly from Verizon brand new. Will absolutely buy me next phone from Verizon Pre-Owned.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is as advertised. Very happy with the phone. It works as expected. Shipping was very quick
<<&&&&>>
It seems to be a replaced screen iPhone X the top wasn’t completely perfect fitted but pressing it got it solved Otherwise it looked like a brand new phone, in great shape. Too bad the cable and charger are not original
<<&&&&>>
the phone was practically brand new i didn’t see a single scratch or dent it was worth the money you might as well buy this instead of a brand new one i don’t usually write reviews but i’m just writing this for people unsure if they should buy it like i was but this is a nice phone in the best condition
<<&&&&>>
Really was excited for this purchase....phone had few scratches but in overall great shape. Sad to say I only had the phone for a few days and now the screen is unresponsive to touch. Tried all resets still dont work so im guessing its hardware. Very dissapointing. I am now trying to return to get a refund.
<<&&&&>>
The device has no apparent damage and battery is practically new. However, Face ID does not work. After several tentatives to set up the Face ID, I went to an Apple Authorized Store and it was diagnosed that Face ID sensor is damaged and also evidences that device had contact with water (oxidation).
<<&&&&>>
Very sleek, no scratches. I like it a lot but Something is wrong with the screen because it keeps glitching and pressing stuff on its own which is super super annoying.
<<&&&&>>
The seller delivered a broken phone that does not power on. Furthermore they sent along a microUSB charger for the iPhone. When a normal iPhone charger was plugged in the charging port appeared to be broken and the charging cable never properly snaps into place. Unsurprisingly the phone never charged or turned on even with a hard reset.
<<&&&&>>
I'm very surprised, the phone was like new! The battery was 94% good, which is amazing. No scratches, the screen was perfect, everything good. Amazing seller!
<<&&&&>>
Received this today and it looked brand new!! Couldn’t find a scratch or ding anywhere. Battery health was at 90% which seems fair to me. I was hesitant to purchase based on reviews but so far I’m happy I did. This is a Christmas gift for my son and he’s going to be very happy with it!
<<&&&&>>
I was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews but I’m glad I went ahead and bought it. The phone is great, looks nw an no visible scratches on the screen. A gear purchase , worth every dollar. I will definitely buy again from this seller, the phone came 2 days earlier.
<<&&&&>>
Received a defective phone - the screen was unresponsive for long stretches of time. They definitely didn’t test the phone before they sent it to me.
<<&&&&>>
I am very pleased with this purchase. The look of the phone is perfect and the battery life is fine for the cost savings. It actually came with a screen protector so I will be returning the one I purchased with the phone. I was also able to easily switch carriers due to the fact that it is unlocked.
<<&&&&>>
Until now the phone sounds good but I didn’t expect the batteries wouldn’t be original from Apple and also didn’t come with headphones.
<<&&&&>>
Was delivered early (someone must be home to sign for it). A great value for the money. The phone looked brand new. Works great. The Battery health was at 93%. Highly recommend.
<<&&&&>>
Came safely. No scratches at all. Was able to set up from old phone in less than an hour and have everything running smoothly. This phone is a little bit bigger than the iPhone SE I previously had and I love the feel of it so far. No glitches and the SIM card installed without a hitch. Definitely will buy again if I have the money and need it!😂 Battery life is at 100%.
<<&&&&>>
If you're not an Apple fan you wouldn't like it. It does everything I expected. It will take some time to get used to the new features but I prefer them over the old.
<<&&&&>>
The pone looks ok, doesnt look used or refurbished but when i opened it, the upper microphone was not working, i have to talk on "speaker" mode in order to hear the other personas voice. I Will ask for a refund or a solution to this
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as expected!! Can hardly see any scratches, battery life was at 92% when I got it, came with charger cord & base, came sooner than expected, & works perfectly!
<<&&&&>>
Had to leave feedback since this is such an expensive item. Arrived a day early. 89% battery health. A few scratches but those were expected since this is a used device. Everything works so far. Tested FaceID (front camera) and pictures and video (rear camera). Will update if I notice any issues. Great deal IMO. Hopefully the wife agree since its for her!
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new and was easy to set up and get ready to use with apps and phone service My cell carrier had no problems adding it to my account
<<&&&&>>
After spending time reading the reviews I wasn’t sure if it would work with Verizon. When I received the phone I popped in my sim and worked perfectly. The phone had minor blemishes... nothing to be concerned with... what you would expect with a refurbished phone. I’ve had the phone for almost a month and everything is working great! Overall I would recommend.
<<&&&&>>
no me gusto mucho este celular por que la batería llega muerta y en verdad esperaba algo mas a la altura
<<&&&&>>
Got this really fast, in excellent condition, have only used it a couple hours so far but no complaints. Looked brand new! Love it!
<<&&&&>>
Maybe one scratch on it, but it’s refurbished so what do you expect, 110% worth the money. Would highly recommend you buy I only wish it came in original packaging. Came at 95% battery health.
<<&&&&>>
It looked new and work like one straight from the store but a third of the price. Bought this for my wife and she loves it. I also have a refurbished Android it has never given any problems. Refurbished is the way to go for me now.
<<&&&&>>
Worst phone I’ve ever had in my life. Has a mind of its own- clicks on whatever it wants and downloads whatever it wants. Honestly feel like I was given a phone that had a virus before. Would rate 0 stars if possible.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is in excellent condition! Very satisfied. The only potential issue I may have is with the battery life. The battery health is coming in at 84%, so I will most likely have to replace it at the Apple store sooner rather than later. But other than that, this is a great purchase and definitely recommend! If in the market again, I will buy from same seller.
<<&&&&>>
I was very weary buying this, but it was definitely worth my money, some minor scratches but who cares. Battery life was at 91%, and all I had to do was put my sim in. very happy with this purchase, thank you!
<<&&&&>>
Phone has intermittent issues... unable to reach seller
<<&&&&>>
description was accurate - phone was easy to set up and get working
<<&&&&>>
Producto funcionando al 100% en Guatemala. La cámara tiene un golpe leve cerca del Flash, tuve mala suerte en eso... pero por lo demás, funcionando perfecto.
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks brand new. Will order more from this vender. Haven’t had any problems SIM card worked no problems at all no dents no scratches nothing.
<<&&&&>>
I just received the iPhone X in silver. It is nowhere near like new condition. The bezels on this one have noticeable wear spots in key areas. The back is covered with tiny clear spots from something splattering. They can take this one back. Don’t waste your time. In terms of condition I would rate it a B-
<<&&&&>>
Still enjoying my iPhone after 2 months I can tell you it’s came in brand new with box and accessories and my import fees was refunded back to me super happy thanks
<<&&&&>>
This was fraudulent on my credit card and I’m terribly disappointed in amazon letting this happen
<<&&&&>>
i item was not in original package, none of the accessories of the phone provided except charging cable which is not original. But cargo was fast.
<<&&&&>>
There are particles (dust, sand, dirt?) blocking the front-facing camera, so photos are worse than my previous iPhone 7. There are scratches on the display, but the phone arrived with a screen protector on it. It looks like there might be some scratches below, but I never removed the screen protector. It works, so that’s good. Battery was at 93% health on arrival.
<<&&&&>>
The phone keeps freezing while using app or browsing web.I have to force-restart each time it happens. It's abolutely dysfunctional and not worth the money I paid.
<<&&&&>>
The model advertised is A1865, the one I received is A1901. Also large and deep scratches on the front screen and many small scratches on screen and back. Returned immediately for refund.
<<&&&&>>
There are many dead spots on the display. It was not that bad at first but progressively got worse so I took to the Apple store. They Said it would cost $250 to fix it. Should of just bought a new phone from the Apple store. Live and learn.
<<&&&&>>
This was a great purchase. It was in a different language for the set up, so I took it to a cellphone place for them to help me set it up! It was a quick easy fix!
<<&&&&>>
iPhone X 64 gb Space gray Desbloqueado Y funcionando perfectamente La batería tiene 87% de vida Vino con cargador genérico pero de carga rápida! 0 rayones en la pantalla , tiene unos en los lados En general por 450$ un excelente teléfono.
<<&&&&>>
Item as described, 100% battery, no scratches
<<&&&&>>
Always choose this guys to purchase refurbished. Havent had problem yet and already got 5 phones so far. No scratches no defects. Happy with my order.
<<&&&&>>
Came as listed works fine ... about 1 or 2 scratches but I don’t mind... works fine...I had to update it myself but that was ok...go ahead and buy this phone
<<&&&&>>
Buen teléfono ninguna falla solamente batería 8/10
<<&&&&>>
Quality depends from item to item. My item received was of good quality.
<<&&&&>>
This was the best decision I ever made buying the iPhone X from amazon. It is so much cheaper
<<&&&&>>
Only thing I noticed with the renewal was some scuff marks at the bottom around the speakers. Other than that everything was perfect.
<<&&&&>>
I've had this phone for a few months now, and no issues whatsoever. Exactly as described and would purchase from this seller again.
<<&&&&>>
nice iphone
<<&&&&>>
Works as advertised
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Parece como nuevo casi ninguna señales de uso solo la batería en un 88 %
<<&&&&>>
This was my first time buying anything Amazon certified refurbished. I was impressed, the phone looked new. When I say the phone looked new I mean no scratches or scuffs at all. The phone operates and functions like brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Iphone X is an ok phone
<<&&&&>>
It was like new, but it is not working well. There are some letters that I can't tipe and sometimes it doesn't unlock. I don't know if is common to this phone or if it is just a matter of luck.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this phone in advance for someone’s birthday. The Seller advertised the phone to be unlocked. I was deeply embarrassed when they went to 2 different stores that said the phone was not unlocked.
<<&&&&>>
A good phone in good condition. Battery life shows 100%. Very minor scratches here and there that you’ll never notice. Will update the review in a few months to let you know whether the performance is still good.
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new. Works good. Screen with almost imperceptible scratches. Really good deal. Battery was 92%
<<&&&&>>
Stop taking pictures and only 30 days old.
<<&&&&>>
Was a bit hesitant to buy at first because of some bad reviews but I was amazed when I open the package my IPhone was in great working condition and looked good as new it’s been 2 months a still no problems if your hesitant to buy I say go for it
<<&&&&>>
Works just fine, price could be better
<<&&&&>>
Battery health is at 100%, No visible damage to the phone AT ALL, good price, great phone!!
<<&&&&>>
Work great
<<&&&&>>
Producto no como fue publicado , muchas rajaduras en la parte trasera .
<<&&&&>>
I bought the iPhone refurbish two week ago, the iPhone hasn’t any scratches. Honestly I’m very satisfied, the quality is very good and all features and sensors are working fine.
<<&&&&>>
Part of the screen was defective and didn't register touch.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was garbage, didn’t use for a month and is totally died. Have been contacting the support center from the very first month I received. The only option I’m left is to stop doing business with you. Frustrated customer
<<&&&&>>
Everything works and came as described.
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great, no problems with shipping or unboxing, came with screen protector, which was an unexpected bonus.
<<&&&&>>
too soon to tell
<<&&&&>>
There is a long scratch on the screen. The seller did not mention it.
<<&&&&>>
Worked perfect for a month then completely died. Brought it to the Genius Bar and fortunately warranty was still active. They replaced phone. Only skeptical about the quality of refurbishment.
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy from this seller. Phone screen is unresponsive. Wasted my time because the seller didn't check the phone first.
<<&&&&>>
Purchase an IphoneX and got an iphone 6s....
<<&&&&>>
Perfect!!!
<<&&&&>>
I expected to see some weed and year on the product but I could not find any scuffs or scratches anywhere on the product. Looks like brand new. Battery life is good so far and it's working great.
<<&&&&>>
I bought two phones and paid for the next day delivery (on Monday) and instead I just received one phone today (Wednesday), I’m really angry and disappointed... I just started an investigation with Amazon.. :/
<<&&&&>>
Good purchase very clean no marks or scuff I buy it from TRADE MORE
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived fast, looks like new and function as expected. I haven’t use a new iPhone X to know how much the battery should last, but I thought that was going to last a little bit more.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente
<<&&&&>>
Arrived like new. No scratches or fault.
<<&&&&>>
The phone had poor reception with T-Mobile. The phone had obvious damage to the case. Apple indicated that the phone antenna sustained damage. I requested replacement. I have not heard from the vendor
<<&&&&>>
Producto excelente, funciona muy bien, y estéticamente excelente!
<<&&&&>>
Battery life at 93%. Worked perfectly with my SIM card!
<<&&&&>>
Purchased through trademore. Looked like new, couldn’t find one scratch. Battery life was at 93% when arrived, now went down to 90% after about a month of use. Phone seems to work like new. Overall, I’m happy with purchase.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in great condition and it works wonderfully.
<<&&&&>>
Fantastic for the price. These are authentic iPhones and completely real and legit. I had my doubts but I ran the serial number through the Apple website to verify the authenticity.
<<&&&&>>
Amazing just git looks brand new came with a real apple charger everything works great came a day early amazing definitely buy
<<&&&&>>
Everything worked. appliance in optimum conditions.
<<&&&&>>
I liked this product but the item was broken and not working so I send it back
<<&&&&>>
Would be 5 stars if they didn’t only give me a charger with an iPhone X!! No headphones equipped to work on this phone or an adapter to use!!!! Very frustrating!! Also came in a generic box!!
<<&&&&>>
Great luck. I saw some negative reviews receiving poor quality products but the phone I got has worked well for several months without any issues
<<&&&&>>
What a good service! Just like a new iPhone X, very little scratch without any dents! Worth to buy as renewed item, and it functions very well
<<&&&&>>
Superb
<<&&&&>>
I was expecting an obviously used phone for the price I payed, but this phone is practically brand new! I am very pleased with the quality.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is very good，I like it!
<<&&&&>>
The product is locked. Its not working.
<<&&&&>>
Phone functions great, a couple of scratches on the back but I slapped on a case and glass screen protector and it looks new. Battery life is at 95%
<<&&&&>>
We are very happy with our new iPhoneX. Excellent purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I had some concerns about my purchase given some of the reviews, but I cannot say anything negative about the product or my experience. Fantastic value and a flawless product.
<<&&&&>>
Superb
<<&&&&>>
Very bad condition
<<&&&&>>
Great buy. Looks , feels, and performs like brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Great purchase! I was hesitant with it being refurbished, but was pleasantly surprised. Great condition. Great battery life. I have already recommended to several friends.
<<&&&&>>
phone came in perfect condition, it’s not stolen, i can get service on it and everything works how it should. was skeptical but i am glad i made this purchase
<<&&&&>>
funcionamiento muy bueno y detalle como nuevo.
<<&&&&>>
El celular llego desbloqueado y en buenas condiciones, tiene algunos rayones pero en general está bien, la batería llego con un 85% de vida útil un poco baja pero bien.
<<&&&&>>
I bought the phone and it was good condition and everything but I tried connecting it to metro pcs and they said the carrier was locked
<<&&&&>>
Sin ninguna señal de uso excelente producto.
<<&&&&>>
So much better than older I phones
<<&&&&>>
No me gustó porque no vino con los audífonos Si compré el celular se supone que viene con todos los accesorios pero faltaron los audífonos. No podían enviármelo?
<<&&&&>>
Phone is working well
<<&&&&>>
Muy malo. El speaker estaba mal
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone that they sent me had a broken camera. Apple told me when the face recognition wasn’t working that it was damaged during the refurb
<<&&&&>>
This turned out to be much better than i thought. the phone was in pristine condition no scratches or anything, it was just like new. will buy it again.
<<&&&&>>
Todo excelente por el momento, se usa en Costa Rica y funciona perfectamente. Vida de la batería en un 90%.
<<&&&&>>
I have had no problems since I’ve bought this phone and I am very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
The screen randomly click on apps or something else and when I type it clicks on random letters and I have to cut my phone off for like 2 minutes.
<<&&&&>>
It's a great phone. It came with a glass screen protector and a charger. There are no scratches on the phone. I highly reccomand it.
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
No me llegó el celular, recibí un comunicado que me devolverían el dinero. No han cumplido. No hay manera de contactarse y reclamar.
<<&&&&>>
The screen was scratched in a corner
<<&&&&>>
Face recognition dont work and is over heating
<<&&&&>>
Works just like it's brand new.
<<&&&&>>
We could not even charge the battery but have to return the product including a case! What a troublesome experience!
<<&&&&>>
Everything was great! Only problem was battery at 91percent but was expected as it is refurbish
<<&&&&>>
Almost a new product. It came without any scratches. Definitely worth it. Just the accessories i though little cheap.
<<&&&&>>
Signos de uso y desgaste en el cel, al ser supuestamente reacondicionado no debería tenerlo, Bateria al 95% no 100% como publican
<<&&&&>>
El reconocimiento facial y la cantidad memoria disponible y la facilidad para transferir los datos del teléfono anterior.
<<&&&&>>
Sucks it camed damGed and kinda frezze
<<&&&&>>
la bateria esta en buen estado, con un 89% de utilidad, y tiene la pantalla un poco rayada
<<&&&&>>
There was a tiny scratch on the screen but it’s gone with the screen protector I bought. I’d recommend
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in pretty much new condition came with a knock off charger but besides that the phone works perfectly
<<&&&&>>
Great Iphone tbh
<<&&&&>>
Charger port on the phone does not work properly I can’t charge my phone regularly and my battery life sucks
<<&&&&>>
I understand that this is a refurbished product but the power button was nearly unusable on the unit I got.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was extremely cheap considering it was an iPhone X, but it was worth every penny
<<&&&&>>
The battery too bed That’s not included earphone Supposed to include it earphone
<<&&&&>>
The phone doesn’t work properly, doesn’t read the SIM card. I cannot use it!
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono llegó en perfectas condiciones, la verdad por el precio que está, es una excelente oferta!!
<<&&&&>>
Bought mine. Fast shipping. Battery at 96% life. And minimal scratches barely noticeable

<<&&&&>>
The phone works perfectly. The battery life is about 93%. Very happy with this purchase. Thanks!!!
<<&&&&>>
I like the phone but I was not able to used my boost mobile sims card in the phone and that sucks
<<&&&&>>
looks and runs like a brand new unit, battery life seems good but not had long enough to prove.
<<&&&&>>
Phone calls had to be on speaker to hear. Green line running down the middle of the screen.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect phone! And works well too! 🤷🏽‍♀️ I don’t know what the others are talking about
<<&&&&>>
SATISFIED this was the real deal my phone is working amazingly with no problems
<<&&&&>>
It haven’t even been a week and the motherboard broke and the phone over heats
<<&&&&>>
Worth the money spent.
<<&&&&>>
The phone works flawless a few small scratches that are seemingly not there.
<<&&&&>>
This price is great and the phone is very new no scratch and battery is well
<<&&&&>>
I needed an upgrade from the 6s and this was definitely an amazing decision.

This phone looks, feels, and acts like it is brand new. It came a day early than it was expected. It arrived in a Trade Mobile packaging box with a chord and outlet to charge it. There are no scratches or cracks on the phone. Buying this phone was a great deal especially since it is going for a much higher price (granted I was a little skeptical). I was able to set it up with no trouble. The only way I can tell it is not a new phone is if I go into the iPhone settings, then general, then about, and then look at the model it says NQCL2LL/A instead of starting with an M (which means new). After looking it up, N apparently means replacement. So the phone I got is a replacement phone that works and looks perfectly fine.
<<&&&&>>
Lamentablemente si el pedido no esta aquí según lo pautado inicialmente lo tendré que devolver, ya que para ese fecha estaré de viaje. Saludos
<<&&&&>>
The most user UNFRIENDLY PHONE EVER PRODUCED! If this were the only cellphone available in the world I would go back to using a CB radio or two tin cans with a string. I despise this phone. The voice recognition software is useless. I tried to say "Hey Siri, I want to book a flight to Tampa, Florida" and it tried to pull up books about tampons in Florida. Every time you pick the stupid thing up it takes a picture of the screen. And speaking of screens, try sending a text message to someone....when you try to tap their name, it ends up calling them instead, when you finally do get the message screen open and you start to type into what you think is the message field, you are typing your message in the "TO:" field. The GPS navigation is a joke. I do not understand people who love Apple products.. Anyone who likes this phone must enjoy being constantly frustrated with trying to do the most simple and mundane of tasks. If you have an iPhone and you love it, you are not my friend! That's right, we have nothing in common and I don't like you because of it. YES, that is me judging you! Call me superficial, call me an idiot, I don't care; I hate this phone more than anything and I don't want to be around people who like it! I will never stray away from an Android based system again.
<<&&&&>>
Recieved this phone yesterday and when I put on the music it sound like the speakers were blown out, super low.
<<&&&&>>
The GSM is locked on the phone i buy.Never worked with my mobile network and the seller dont want to help me.Dont waste your money try other sellers
<<&&&&>>
I love this I phone
<<&&&&>>
el producto llego en perfectas condiciones. solo con una pequena raya en la pantalla, excelente
<<&&&&>>
HONEST REVIEW: Small scartch betwee bolume buttons but barely noticeable. Great for the price
<<&&&&>>
my mom bought this cellphone, the face id doesn't work! is not refurbished its a lie
<<&&&&>>
I love this phone.. it’s so neat. I’m so amazed
<<&&&&>>
The price is too much!
<<&&&&>>
Was nice and everything
<<&&&&>>
I don't think the iPhone X is a bad phone overall, I just got a bad refurbished one from Trademore Mobile. It looked brand new but the touch screen had a dead area so I was never able to even set up the phone.
<<&&&&>>
iPhone X came with 94% battery life. It looks almost new. One or 2 tiny scratches and no other issues so far. The phone powered on immediately and was fully charged. Even though the phone was described as GSM unlocked only and not suited for Verizon my Verizon sim worked. It’s model number A1865 which I found on the web as the fully unlocked model. So, you may want to look for that when ordering. I now have a MintMobile sim in the phone and it works on T-Mobile towers. I’ve had no issues so far and was happy for the price I paid $584. You should watch the price because it fluctuates. I will update if anything changes with the phone’s functionality.
<<&&&&>>
I recently decided to upgrade from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone X. I was unimpressed with any enhanced features, and namely the new face recognition to unlock the device. After the first two days of owning the new iPhone, I was over it. Gone was the ease of simply using a finger print to unlock the phone. This became annoying since I have to have a passcode on the phone and many apps I use day to day require either a pin or passcode which would generally use the finger id. Yes, the face recognition would unlock the device, but I had to literally pickup the phone every time I wanted to access email, text messages, or review information in an app. Previously, my phone could rest on my desk, I simply use my finger id to unlock and easily access whatever. Now, I have to pick up the phone or make it obvious I am accessing something on my phone. Aside from the new facial recognition, there is nothing really feature enhanced from the iPhone 7. Sure, you can argue, better camera etc, but that is minimal and not worth the money or upgrade with something already awesome. The downside was i didn't even own the phone for 3 weeks and the screen stopped working, the phone wouldn't power on... very disappointing.
<<&&&&>>
The IPhone X 256 I received works perfectly. 90% battery health. Looks brand new, no scratches or wear of used that I could see. Came with a screen protector. And for the money ...I am totally happy with this iPhone X. I was under the impression that fully unlocked meant that it could be used with any carriers (Tmobile,att&t GSM carriers and Verizon, Sprint CDMA carriers. But my IPhone X that I received according to the model number only works with GSM carriers. So if your looking for a fully unlocked iPhone for all Carriers I would recommend contacting the seller to make sure you are receiving the fully unlocked iPhone X.
<<&&&&>>
So far the phone has been great. It came with a small but noticeable scratch on the back glass, which was expected. I was very disappointed with how it was packaged and protected in the packaging. I’ve bought screen protectors that have come in a more secure package. It came in a box inside a padded envelope. When I opened the envelope my box was destroyed (which I do know isn’t the fault of the seller but of bad shipping and handeling. My point is that it should’ve been protected in the event that the shipping wasn’t careful). It was pure luck that the phone itself wasn’t broken. It just didn’t give me the best feeling. I was disappointed to be honest. I wish it would’ve come in a box similar to the box which iPhones originally come in, being more similar to a case than a cheap paper box. The phone itself is great so far. The wall charger and cord are off brand which was again expected. Everything works well. Other than being sent in a sketchy package overall, I’m happy with the product itself. Better than I expected actually.. and that’s why I’m giving 4 stars.
<<&&&&>>
I've ordered this phone twice, and both times I received a GSM-only phone. The description clearly says "Fully unlocked for both GSM carriers (like AT&T and T-Mobile) and CDMA carriers (like Sprint and Verizon)." This is not true. This phone doesn't work on Verizon.
<<&&&&>>
The phone worked well for about two months then the screen stopped working. I figured it was something wrong with the phone itself either due to myself or the age of the phone. I took it to a repair shop and they said the ribbon wires that connect the screen to the main chip was folded and crunched in there. They went as far as to say whoever refurbished the phone did a awful job and it caused the screen to stop working.
<<&&&&>>
My order just delivered with scratches on front/back/sides - I don't really understand the situation where the glass on the back of the phone has just scratches and worn out.. unless you intentionally rub it on hard surfaces. I saw some bad feedbacks for the phone presentations but thought it's just few and may not happen to me, no no... I wouldn't risk again for the $500 (+tax) phone. Buy from the seller if you want "renewed", "looking like new" phone with scratches everywhere.
<<&&&&>>
Tenía dudas pero llegó al segundo día, al abrir la caja que no era original me asuste pero al ver el teléfono paso a segundo plano en la caja había solo el teléfono, el cubo y un cable no hubo audífonos como decía la publicación al prender el teléfono me pidió conectar el cargador pues estaba batería baja al conectar duro al menos unos 30 minutos para lograr el 80% de carga al prender lo primero que revisé fue la capacidad de la batería y al indicador mostró 93% de efectividad más de lo esperado, en lo físico el teléfono esta flamante no tiene ni un rayón es sorprendente ya que en la publicación decía que puede tener rayones o algo similar pero está perfecto al colocar el chip funciona perfecto el FACE ID funciona perfecto

I ordered this phone with some trepidation. I don't think there's any way the phone I received could have been any better. There wasn't a mar, scratch or any sign that the phone had ever been used. The battery health was at 100%. I transferred the info from my old iPhone into the iPhone X, popped in the sim and I was happily using my X. Great deal.
<<&&&&>>
What a great buy! Phone is in pristine condition and even had a screen protector already on it. Battery life is 98%. Synced with my iCloud account perfectly and was instantly able to access my cellular provider when I inserted my SIM card. Almost like buying a new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in generic box with generic charger. Screen and overall shape of the phone is in great condition for being "used". Came fully unlocked as advertised (can use any SIM) and battery health says it's 95%. Very happy, was able to transfer my data from my IPhone 6 with the icloud and popped in my Verizon SIM card no problem.
<<&&&&>>
Not worth it at all I got an iPhone X with a very badly scratched up screen for $700 save your money
<<&&&&>>
Regular Bluetooth is not connected to airpords. When the airpords leave their ears and can not be connected every time they are put back into their ears, it is extremely inconvenient and extremely disgusting.
<<&&&&>>
If I could rate it ZERO I would do that! At first When I received iPhone X 64gb it was ok. But I took a look and found out that the phone has unoriginal screen. The seller tried to hide it and covered it with screen protection. The speaker doesn’t work at all. Looks like the seller thinks that clients are idiots. It’s so disrespectful!
<<&&&&>>
Decent, and far cheaper than anything, but when I received it, the listening part of the phone when you make calls is always muffled. Didn't come with all accessories or book as noted, but it would have been nice to get.
<<&&&&>>
Don’t get it when I got the phone it was working fine but then the next day it kept turning off and on Apple couldn’t do anything but look at it there is nothing I can do to fix it myself
<<&&&&>>
Love the new size and special security. Had some trouble setting up the SIM chip, but seems to be working great now!
<<&&&&>>
Wife loved it, came in a generic box wrapped in plastic with after market charger but phone was still good
<<&&&&>>
I ordered from declutter and received it with no charger block a bent sim card tool and a imitation back glass with no branding just a blank back glass
<<&&&&>>
Came exactly as specified. Would highly recommend this seller.
<<&&&&>>
I loved how this phone looks and works, no scratches or anything, fast and secure delivery. I’m very satisfied. I really recommend buying them.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in generic packaging. Worked good out of the box. No complaints so far. Good value.
<<&&&&>>
Upgraded from 7
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in great condition. Ain’t regret at all🙅‍♀️ love it 😍 was so anxious to see my phone 😁😁recommended buy! Phone came like new 🙌🙌
<<&&&&>>
Literally perfect. I am so happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
So far running great without problems. No scratches or sign of renewed phone. Very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
My device came as new, no scratches, no damages, battery health of 100%. Original charger and cable. The only thing that was not original was the box.
<<&&&&>>
Me llegó rápidamente, contenta con la compra
<<&&&&>>
Excelent
<<&&&&>>
Little pricey
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone. I will never buy a phone at retail again.
<<&&&&>>
Pristine condition
<<&&&&>>
The best iPhone I've owned yet, very fast, very bright and clear display, love it
<<&&&&>>
Great phone no problems at all great price the phone is like new
<<&&&&>>
A+
<<&&&&>>
Great stuff, the device very smooth no scratches at all👍
<<&&&&>>
So cute, excellent cell
<<&&&&>>
El iPhone funciona perfectamente.
<<&&&&>>
I love it
<<&&&&>>
Very good, the seller presented a charging device
<<&&&&>>
Switched back to iPhone from Samsung. The biggest mistake. I spent three hours trying to get my old iTunes password. They say it may take a week. Well, that was a waste of money. Samsung was so much easier to use. I only switched because of buy one get one and now I need to decide if the $100 restock is worth the pain.
<<&&&&>>
I got this item super quickly (ordered on Christmas and received that following Friday) and it has been perfect so far. Was very easy to set up the phone to my phone company (Verizon) and has all of the amazing features. Works exactly like a new phone. haven't had any technical difficulties with the phone thus far. Would highly recommend buying this item.
<<&&&&>>
It was as advertised where the phone was like new, so I'm very happy with the decision to go with an Amazon refurbished device. Battery life shows at 92%, but it doesn't last as long as my iphone 8, but it sounds like that may be normal even when new. Cord and charger were the only disappointment. They were 3rd party and not working.
<<&&&&>>
First time ordering a phone on Amazon and I must say I was a little skeptical but the phone arrived on time and it is as good as new. I am pretty pleased. Now to dowloading apps and getting it going.
<<&&&&>>
Over the course of two years owning this phone, I have noticed that the battery life has significantly decreased, the phone overheats to simple tasks, and within the first week of me owning the phone the screen looked like it had been scratched with sandpaper (I never dropped it once).
<<&&&&>>
This phone came sooner than expected looks brand new and it performs exactly as expected!
<<&&&&>>
This phone is working around the wold... The model A1865
<<&&&&>>
Came with a light scratch on the bottom right side of the screen and a small scratch on the outside edge on the upper left hand side. Connection went smoothly on Sprint network. Everything works as it should. Only came with charging cable, wall adapter, and the sim pin. Will update this review if anything changes as this is my 3rd day using this iPhone X. Very pleased with the purchase overall.
<<&&&&>>
Good product
<<&&&&>>
Wireless-Globe, I was purchased 1100$ for IphoneX.But I got defect IPhone X.It doesn't receiveing the incoming call to my IPhoneX.Please tell me how can i refund this productand my money. Thanks,
<<&&&&>>
There is the phone that is all. No headphone, no original charger, no original box. I felt kinda scared.
<<&&&&>>
Phon with a lot of scratches and don’t switch on
<<&&&&>>
I love it! It looks just like brand new and everything works great. My international SIM card worked perfectly! I'm really happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
Works well. Came with a good bubble wrap protection. Accessories are not original, came with power lightning cable and USB charger.
<<&&&&>>
I was very nervous about buying a refurbished phone, but everyone in my 5 person family all needed a new phone at the same time. I knew that would be costly since we use Straight Talk and would have to buy unlocked phones at full cost up front. I am writing this review for all three phones I purchased from this seller, but I will only attach photos of the specific phone the review is attached to. 2 - iPhone X 1 - iPhone Xs Max All refurbished. The phones came well packaged in "Certified Refurbished" boxes. All phones are GSM or Fully Unlocked and all work with Straight Talk service. I was able to just transfer the SIM card they were already using to the new phones without service interruption. ***iPhone X 256gb (Silver): The back is flawless. The screen has VERY minor blemishes that appear to have been caused by over buffing/polishing the glass. Nowhere near bad enough to send the phone back. I mean... I got an iPhone X 256gb for $500. I seriously can't complain about that. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is a HUGE upgrade from my 12 year olds Samsung Galaxy S4 which was a hand-me-down to make sure she was responsible enough for a phone. To say she is ecstatic is an understatement. This phone gets an A- for the scratches on the screen and the fact that it was missing the sim card key. (Btw, the Silver looks more like white.) iPhone X 256gb (Space Gray): The screen is flawless. The back has extremely minor wear and tear scratches. Nothing a case won't cover up. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is an upgrade from my 16 year olds Samsung Galaxy S7 which was a hand-me-down because he broke his old iPhone 5 (Don't let your kid put their phone in their backpack with heavy textbooks!). He is so happy to have a "new to you" iPhone. This phone gets an A++ for having all promised parts and better than expected condition. You can't beat a price of $520 for this condition either! iPhone Xs Max 256gb (Space Gray): This phone had wear and tear scratches all over. Like they never used a case, but never dropped it either. This one was bought for my husband. He chose a refurbished Xs Max over the new 11 Pro Max because as a firefighter, he is extremely rough on his phones. $700 was way better than $1,500. He upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Other than the minor cosmetic issues, this phone has exceeded our expectations. It gets an A simply because of the cosmetics, which wear easily covered with a screen protector and an Otterbox. Over all, I do recommend this seller. And if you want to save some money, or you're buying a phone for your kids who will more than likely break it, don't be afraid to try a refurbished phone.

I ordered this phone on the 15th and it came two days later! The only downside is it doesn’t come in the original package. Other than that, it’s perfect and I’m in love with it. 😃 My issue with my previous phone was that it started getting slower and the volume was horrible on phone calls. This phone is quite the opposite & it’s very loud. You won’t be disappointed.(:
<<&&&&>>
Was a bit nervous about purchasing this iPhone X. The reviews seemed to have been mixed. I rolled the dice and ordered it and when it arrived I was very very happy to see that this phone had zero scratches and no dents. The iPhone X arrived in like new condition. I have owned the phone good now a few weeks and have no issues to report. I'm a very satisfied customer.
<<&&&&>>
+The exterior of the refurbished iPhone X I ordered was just like new! not a single scratch! +I live in Germany and this unlocked phone worked flawlessly with the German network. +It came with the front protective glass screen already installed. Nice touch! +It also had (aftermarket) charger and cable. -The max battery capacity is at 94% when compared to a new one, but I guess that is somewhat expected for a refurbished phones
<<&&&&>>
Apple X, cant say enough. I purchase this phone used and unlocked for $850. the phone screen came fast but was blemished or scratched under screen protector. I don't really care. Good phone. Don't buy phones from bit phone companies. They swindle you out of $1200 for long pay.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is as good as new. Everything works perfectly. It came with the charger as well.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was reported stolen
<<&&&&>>
Arrived faster than expected. The set up was very easy. Product looks and functions like new. No scratches or dents. Just be careful from what seller you buy from. I got from BUYSPRY and I have no complaints.
<<&&&&>>
I work overseas and needed a work phone that would run on the local Sim card. I bought this phone and it worked great in the US under my AT&T sim card. I had to go overseas and when I landed I inserted the sim into the phone and it would not activate. I am lucky I packed my old unlocked iPhone 5 and inserted the sim into it and it fired up without issues. I then sent and email explaining the issue and got a reply back that said Do a hard reboot to the phone and it should be fine. I did that several times, and the same issue. I have called three times and don't get any answer, and have left a few messages, but no reply. I have also sent a couple emails with no reply. please think twice before dealing with this company.
<<&&&&>>
The front facing camera stopped working after 8 months of use. Contacted Amazon and BuySPRY - neither will offer a refund or exchange. Customer support and device longevity is poor. DO NOT BUY. Update: After further talking with Amazon, they've offered me a refund for the phone. Changing my rating to 3 stars.
<<&&&&>>
Finger print rate is actually for the face ID. But the phone is like new! There’s really no scratches on front or back and there’s no problems at all. I definitely think it’s worth $470 for the 256 Gbs 👍👍 Although the battery peak performance is at 89%, which definitely isn’t bad, i feel they should put new ones in. Definitely just my opinion though.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone X come in good condition, I love it, I’m very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
The phone didn't worked, so i had to send it back, but, tech support is the reason i give 5 stars to a not working phone. Great support!!!
<<&&&&>>
This item is garbage, got it out of the box plugged it in, it goes into overheating mode all the time sometimes it’s ok for a few hours other times it’s every few minutes
<<&&&&>>
I have straight talk and my previous iPhone X accidentally took a bath in the toilet... 😑. The repair man didn’t get it fixed in time and basically ruined it. I started shopping for a replacement on amazon and at first was nervous because of the mixed reviews for the seller. I decided to take a risk and buy anyway because of amazon purchase protection. The phone arrived earlier than expected, powered on, and worked perfectly with my straight talk sim!!! The phone looks brand new and has been functioning perfectly! I definitely would recommend this seller!
<<&&&&>>
The one I received won’t hold charge even with a new battery. It was also carrier locked to Mint Mobile. When it seems too good to be true it always is. Lesson learned. Would NEVER do business with them again. Customer service is also terrible and not helpful!
<<&&&&>>
Bought this one last month We're always scare to buy a deffective product. This one is working very well, no scratch, look brand new - the only complaint is that phone kinda heat sometime not sure if it's normal.
<<&&&&>>
I loved it came all packaged very clean! Was deff kinda second guessing after reading some comments but it all worked out because the phone was excellent!
<<&&&&>>
Had the phone a little over a year now and the battery is still good charges fast does everything a iPhone suppose to do has great camera quality is water resistant not waterproof meaning it can be dropped in water but after a certain amount of feet pressure will concede otherwise loud speaker great with airpods awesome with Apple Watch only had cracked screen protector worth the money for a phone that’ll feel comfortable in your hand
<<&&&&>>
This phone hasn’t worked since I got it. Constantly says “cellular update failed” and will not let me use SMS or calls. Doesn’t even connect to WiFi sometimes. Useless brick of glass. I took it to the apple store and even they didn’t know what was wrong and gave it back to me. I have tried every single thing and end up in the same place. Do not buy from them.
<<&&&&>>
phone works great, comes with an original OLED screen and I never had any issue with it. The price was too good to pass up for an iPhone 10!
<<&&&&>>
Just like a new iphone, minor srcatches in the back but everything else its good
<<&&&&>>
the product itself came perfect in the package and was unlocked so my sim worked. the package itself was shady and the cord wasn’t apple product. the phone also didn’t come with headphones but that wasn’t necessarily too bad i jsut went out and bought some. overall the phone works fine for me, sometimes it’s a bit slow but functions great and works as expected. great buy.
<<&&&&>>
No original package with no headphones or charger , adaptors
<<&&&&>>
be wary before buying this phone because it’s NOT fully unlocked and is only compatible with certain providers even though it doesn’t say anything about that on the site
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in 2 days early, came in great condition, looked like a brand new phone. I’m happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
The renewed products I have had in the past were great. This phone looks fine, except thee were a group of scratches on t top left of the front screen
<<&&&&>>
The cell phone arrived at the indicated times. I was so pleased that I bought another one to give it to my partner to give it to him at Christmas Thanks Amazon
<<&&&&>>
The phone i received is not unlocked and the sim card tray is missing, I expect a refund
<<&&&&>>
Excelent, like new!
<<&&&&>>
This was the best purchase I have ever made. The phone came in an off brand box as usual. I took the phone out and it powered straight on. No problems setting it up. The battery life came at 93% which isn’t that bad. I got the 256GB silver model. It came on time lien it said. I would recommend this seller.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone, fast shipping, great price. There were however more scratches on the screen than I anticipated. No cracks or defections but the screen was more scratched up than what I would expect for a certified refurbished phone
<<&&&&>>
Came on time and as described! Only cosmetic issue was a scratch on the front that is noticeable but definitely not a dealbreaker. Absolutely no cracks or chips anywhere. Popped my SIM card in and was good to go right from the start. Came with a screen protector, and a generic cord and wall plug.
<<&&&&>>
theres ascratch on the glass on the side of the phone. also the white powder all over the face of the microphone. the price was cheated. decelived
<<&&&&>>
Got if as a present for my sister. She is happy, and everything works perfect so far.
<<&&&&>>
Good product
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono no funciona al 100. solo se pone en silencio y en sonido sin necesidad de activarlo personalmente para que tengan en cuanta eso. Gracias buenas noches
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks practically new. Pristine screen and back, only minor scratches around the charger port. The charger port, however, is slightly loose; smallest move can dislodge the charger but it’s fine.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition and in working order. No problems with setup or use
<<&&&&>>
Phone matches to the description. No scratches, dents or cracks on the device. It works as good as new. I'm glad that I didn't face any problems with my device so far. I've been using it for the last 6 months or so. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
👍
<<&&&&>>
Phone has way to many scratches then I expected. Screens has been changed. It so obvious because it’s I slightly altered. If I can get my refund I’d appreciate that. I’d gladly return the defensive item.
<<&&&&>>
I received the iPhone early than expected but phone wasn't detecting other networks. I did "Reset network settings", "Reset All Settings", "Hard Reset"... Nothing worked.. So I returned the phone at the same day I received.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is ok but no box and pack unprofessional charging cable white and black plug unprofessional it look like $5 phone after looking at it beause of box that that the put the phone in and the way the pack it
<<&&&&>>
Solicite este producto como nuevo, y pue sla sorpresa es que venia usado a pesar que se solicitó como. Nuevo. Funciin claro que si. Pero no es lo que solicité
<<&&&&>>
Was reading the reviews and was scared it might be scratched or cracked but it came just fine!! Looks completely new! So happy with such a bargain!
<<&&&&>>
So far now issues.. just a couple minor scratches
<<&&&&>>
Unfortunately the phone was locked and had to return it. On the bright side- BuySPRY approved the return immediately.
<<&&&&>>
I'm from Ecuador, I bought it because I was on vacation and I didn't have time to return it. The face id does not work. How is it possible to sell it like that? I've been robbed
<<&&&&>>
the screen sometimes works another no,
<<&&&&>>
He comprado este articulo y ha venido en desperfecto estado el lector de tarjeta sim no estaba funcionando y por lo tanto no tenia datos, pesima compra , 0 estrellas de 5.
<<&&&&>>
The WiFi doesn’t work, I need to repair
<<&&&&>>
the charger is not original, it disappointed me a lot and the screen came with little scratches and it looks like the screen is another color.
<<&&&&>>

It was slow and never would work with WiFi
<<&&&&>>
There were some scratches on the edges but otherwise it’s beautiful and I love it
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
It's awful
<<&&&&>>
It came with a box without the Classic screen protector as the new ones, no 3.5mm Jacky - lightning adaptaer, just with de wall Charger and a usb-lightning cable it seems like new.
<<&&&&>>
Actually using this very phone to write this review. Everything looked and worked like brand new. Couldn’t tell it was refurbished. Trust this seller definitely
<<&&&&>>
I in love with this refutbished ihoneX
<<&&&&>>
Excelente
<<&&&&>>
The phone had high evidence of wear and tear, scratches all over
<<&&&&>>
Good value for the 256 Gb model. Did not provide an apple product charger but an after product charger.
<<&&&&>>
I bought my iPhone back in April 2019, and in November 2019, not even a year old, the touch screen started not to work. Went to an Apple store to get it fixed, and $300 later I find it’s one of the wires that was twisted that caused the screen not to work.
<<&&&&>>
Renewed iPhone X works really well just had to get used to the changes
<<&&&&>>
came with scratches all over the screen but only one that is really noticeable but it said that they are supposed to be like new. other than that it works fine
<<&&&&>>
Works perfect for any GSM network
<<&&&&>>
Very nice phone, like new for good price. It came fast.
<<&&&&>>
some accesories was missing
<<&&&&>>
Arrived on time and is working just fine
<<&&&&>>
After reading reviews, I was skeptical of making the purchase. The lull between the order being placed and delivery had me worrying I would open a box and pull out a chunk of scrap metal. However, this was not the case. It did show up in a generic white box and it did include an Apple charger and wall adapter. I had to charge it roughly 5 minutes before being able to power on. I went through the setup process and it asked if I wanted to allow the “Township of (can’t recall) access to remotely monitor this device”. It gives you the option to select remove monitoring and goes through another factory reset. My package arrived a day earlier through FedEx. The lighting in my picture makes it seem if the top edge has a stain of a scuff. This is not the case. I used the markup feature on my iPhone and blacked out the serial number and circled the only damage visible. If you are considering saving money on an iPad, pull the trigger.
<<&&&&>>
Came in a plain white box, so may not make a good gift, but iPad is in like new condition. You would not know it was a refurbished item if not for a little black (easily removed) sticker. Had it for a few days now and works fine, looks great, and holds a charge fine. So far can’t ask for more, thank you seller, for being a good refurbisher and an honest seller. UPDATE: had it for a month now and still works like a champ. This is a good company and their referb'd iPads work great. No battery issues so far.
<<&&&&>>
Cracked the screen on my iPad Air 2 and they wanted $300.00 to replace the screen then I found this one which has 64 gb mine was only 16gb and I had it the next day, needed to update the software but other than that it works great! Just like a brand new one, I am very happy with this purchase and will be buying a few more shortly for my business.
<<&&&&>>
The i Pad air 2 that I bought from Jem Jem Renew is refurbished and half the price of new. It is working great and Im very satisfied with the product and the distributor that sold me my second I pad. The first I Pad I had was third generation and needed a update. The storage was full and made the i Pad slow from start up to close. Now with the Air 2 I pad, I breeze through many sites and multi task without a problem
<<&&&&>>
I was disappointed with the unit I received. It works fine, but shows signs of heavy use. I would consider it a grade C item. When I contact seller VIUS, he called me on the telephone and told me he would need pictures to prove the damage. I sent pictures and he replied that he couldn't see the damage and I would be subject to a 25% restocking fee if I returned it.
<<&&&&>>
One of the iPads I bought had scratches on the screen.
<<&&&&>>
The refurbished iPad had engravings on the back. This should have been mentionned on the product description.
<<&&&&>>
When my wife’s old iPad started to give her problems we bought this refurbished Air 2 and I must say that it looks and operates like a new one. Can’t give any details on how long it will last, but at this time we are very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
It’s very good now, but when we first bought it, it was on IOS 7 or 8(I don’t remember) but it took over 1 day to update it to the current IOS. It was annoying but now it runs perfect and the screen is very very clear!!
<<&&&&>>
I bought this iPad specifically because the listing says that it comes with iOS 8. This one did not, it came with 11.4 or something. Also, it will not charge. You have to wiggle the plug to hit the sweet spot so it will charge. I left it on the charger all night and it was not charging at all. At work I was able to charge it enough to check which iOS it is running. Granted I had to sit and hold the charger end in a particular position in order to get 5% charge on it. I have contacted the seller two times, first time the night I picked up the iPad and told him about the charging issue. Then, I sent an email earlier today. Pretty disappointed. The iPad is in pretty good condition, it was shipped in a box in a box but was not secured in the first box.
<<&&&&>>
Absolutely perfect condition. Came neatly packaged in a white box, fitted inside for the product, had a clear soft shell case already installed, had brand new apple branded charger and a new lightning cable, no scratches anywhere, looks brand new, smells new, setup was a snap, just set iPhone next to it and it transfers all of your info to the iPad. Automatically ran update to ios12 and backup from iCloud. All my apps automatically transferred. Checked the battery condition and it has 100% health, don’t know if it’s a new battery but may as well be. Storage capacity was as advertised 64gb. Thoroughly satisfied. Considered buying one for my wife after seeing the condition of this one vs the price, may do so soon.
<<&&&&>>
Only one forth of the apps would load. Had to return for refund. Reordered (apparently from a different company) and the second one would not activate. How difficult would it be to test them before shipping them out?
<<&&&&>>
This is a huge improvement over the iPad 3rd generation that I had. It’s faster than the old one and has all the good features of the iPhone in a bigger screen but it’s thinner than a regular iPad. It’s thin and lightweight and can be carried around easily, the older iPad was heavy. If you put a decent case on this iPad Air it seems very durable to impacts and day to day usage without making it heavy. Very good value for the money, the power of a computer in a lightweight package that don’t cost a fortune, what more could you ask for? Now if the software works as good as they say we’re in business. The updates sometimes bloat apple products with useless features.
<<&&&&>>
Very pleased with the iPad and the service. Not a scratch on it, looks and works like it’s brand new! Thanks!
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this primarily to replace my Kindle paperwhite which was not easy for me to operate. I have had Apple products for several years and had no complaint about them. I hoped that the iPad would live up to my "Apple" expectations. It has, and then some. I have ordered a keyboard to go with it and can see a time when it could be my main computing platform. Also, even though it is refurbished, there is nothing operational or external that would lead me to believe it was used by someone before I got it. Yup, I am a happy camper with this iPad.
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with purchase. I was skeptical ordering this online but very happy with the customer service and the item was as described.
<<&&&&>>
Beautiful, fast, works like a new one
<<&&&&>>
Guys this iPad is great, dont listen to the other reviews the iPad has good battery life which is a plus and it can be updated to the IOS 12.2 The product arrived sooner than the delivery date stipulated, the product came with a charger no scratches and looked brand new. Works perfectly
<<&&&&>>
works fine just be ready to have it charge for 3 hours to get to 100%. i forgot how long it took these things to charge. i use this for my autistic son to keep him preoccupied. kind of annoying when its low on battery and you have to pry it from his little fingers to charge for 3-4 hours.
<<&&&&>>
Literally good as new. It looks new and comes with a charger and charging cable. It comes in an Excellent Amazon box and packaging. I have about 10 iPads in our house and this iPad is just as good.
<<&&&&>>
iPad came well packaged and has worked perfectly. Far exceeds my old iPad that I’ve used for over 10 years. The battery life is much longer that my first one ever was. Love the finger print ID feature. Surprisingly easy to transfer all my stuff from old to the.new one.
<<&&&&>>
My 11 year old son saved up to purchase a preowned iPad and this was the best deal online. It came with a screen protector on which was a nice gesture. The iPad did however, have a scratch on the back which was probably done to scratch of some previous personalization emblem or something. A cover obviously covers it so it’s not really an issue. iPad works perfectly!!! Thanks!!
<<&&&&>>
It came looking quite new, getting all my information from the previous iPad was easy and flawless. My only complaint so far is that it doesn't hold the charge well. After 3hrs it really starts dropping fast. My iPad Air would go the entire day without having to recharge.
<<&&&&>>
I don’t want to buy it any more
<<&&&&>>
So far, this tablet has done all I need it to do. Battery life seems very good. Appearance was excellent. It was purchased for work applications and has performed well. If anything changes, I'll update my review.
<<&&&&>>
At a hair over $200, this is a steal.
<<&&&&>>
The iPad works well, battery life is great, so it appears they truly replaced it, and no scratches on the screen. There is an etched out spot where it appears there had been engraving, but it's covered by my case anyway. Very happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
This was a gift. My friend is very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
I LOOVVVEEE IT . I would buy again if I had someone to buy one for 😩‼️ ITS SOO PRETTY, and worth the price! I wasn’t too worried about this product having any defects because it’s an Amazon Refurbished item. I bought this for personal use, just to kill my boredom. It arrived in a white box, packaged well. Came with charger & port. Looks so nice. Only thing is it does take a longer time to fully charge versus charging a phone . GOOD BUY!
<<&&&&>>
Always had an Ipad. Mine was getting old. Got this for xmas. Works great. love to play my games on it
<<&&&&>>
The iPad had issues with battery from the start and the screen had a bright spot in the middle that bothered me because I’m ocd.
<<&&&&>>
Great value, but it had a blown pixel within a month and they weren’t responsive to my complaint.
<<&&&&>>
My first Apple ! Arrived in great condition 70% battery charge, and it had been factory reset. Worked like a charm and allowed software update. Came with generic charger and lightning cable but they work OK. The battery life is a concern. Discharges faster than my wife's IPAD 2017. Was shipped in a box in a bubble wrap envelope via FEDEX. VERY HAPPY so far, hope it lasts me years.
<<&&&&>>
The charger never worked properly and I tried to resolve and no help.. now it’s totally dead. Will not charge.. something inside charging port not working. Will never buy refurbished one again
<<&&&&>>
I love my ipad!!!!
<<&&&&>>
My friend had an older I-Pad that pooped out. So I bought her this one for her birthday. It's a gift, I know she uses every day.
<<&&&&>>
Bad decision to purchase. Home button sticks, reboots randomly.
<<&&&&>>
Just arrived with scratches on the screen. Going back.
<<&&&&>>
I was more than skeptical at first but this thing came in awesome and it's working great. Even got here faster than I thought. The tracking on this product was very spotty though.
<<&&&&>>
Very good replacement for IPAD previously. Just wish that APPLE would have diagnostics for their products which would give a hint or warning that they are about to go kaput. 1 day before, the old IPAD worked fine, next day nothing.
<<&&&&>>
They send me a what ever product, the sound wasn’t working and they kept the pen and a charger that doesn’t work with the device at all. Thanks for nothing
<<&&&&>>
Works just for what I needed it for. Great price!
<<&&&&>>
The first iPad I received was defective but the seller replaced it very quickly and with no problem. I received my new one in just 3 days after I returned the other one. I have no problem with this one ( just got in 3 days ago) and am just getting to know my way around in it. So far so good.
<<&&&&>>
I was very disappointed in this product. The description said it was "like new". The product I received had a dent on the back, scratches on the glass screen, and scratches on the side. While it functioned fine, it had a lot of wear on it.
<<&&&&>>
Couldn’t be more happier with this purchase, works as advertised, and shipped fast. It was like new. Highly recommend
<<&&&&>>
Works just as if it was new. Great condition.
<<&&&&>>
Didn’t feel refurbished. The device had evident signs of wear and tear.
<<&&&&>>
This was an amazing purchase. The tablet is absolutely pristene. No scratches, no wear. Just like the first time it was unboxed, the unit is perfect! And for less than half the new price!
<<&&&&>>
I use it constantly at work and play.
<<&&&&>>
Works great!
<<&&&&>>
I am an apple fan. This works for me without buying the newest edition.
<<&&&&>>
Seems to work well. Appearance was pristine. Good value. Charging cable is very cheap and will not charge Ipad. It will charge Iphone. Not a big deal. Did not expect a good charging cable and was not disappointed. Overall happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Best deal around is here on amazon!
<<&&&&>>
Returned it. Volume buttons not working.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent purchase! Just received today. Will update review if anything doesn't work well. Bought it for my son's speech app and it's in extremely good condition. Came charged, ready to go. Took no time hardly to set it up. Maybe for some it's a crap shoot on the quality but we ended up with a great one!
<<&&&&>>
Arrived on time. Works as it should.
<<&&&&>>
I was unsure about what to expect but it is great
<<&&&&>>
It seems great!
<<&&&&>>
Use at work.
<<&&&&>>
Looks new
<<&&&&>>
I was a little skeptical about getting this iPad as it’s been 5 years since its release and previously owned. However it came like brand new and works brilliantly. I was able to update to the current 13.2 OS. I’m beyond happy I took the chance on this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Good stuff and I will recommend anyone who wants to buy one of these, my son loves it
<<&&&&>>
Purchased the Air 2 as a gift. The iPad is in excellent shape, and it arrived quickly. I can not review the battery life as I only charged it up ran the setup and updates with no issues. I did play videos for a few hours and it only dropped about 12% of the battery life.
<<&&&&>>
Quite firm
<<&&&&>>
Was sent the wrong color ordered space grey got silver and the battery is garbage it barely lasts over an hour from fully charged to dead. Buyer beware!
<<&&&&>>
This iPad appears almost as new. It updated the os as soon as I linked it to my account. All functions seem to be working fine. Only up to day 5 with it so time will tell. As of now I couldn’t be happier with this purchase. Thank You
<<&&&&>>
Llegó antes y prácticamente nueva
<<&&&&>>
I did not like how it was delivered, my daughter lives in an apartment on the ground floor and this package was left on the doorstep. I found this utterly stupid with all the thieving going on. It is just being used for personal use and she seems happy with I.
<<&&&&>>
Unfortunately i purchased 2 ipad air 2 but both have alot of scratchs in the screen and from behind also with very cheap charger charging slowly also very clear the screen not original Not value for maney unfortunately i regret buying both
<<&&&&>>
Love it
<<&&&&>>
For check email and we chat,

Battery life
<<&&&&>>
It was missing safari.
<<&&&&>>
Overall it’s a Good product, takes great photos & has a fast response when typing. Downloading & uploading is fast. Battery is adequate but could last longer
<<&&&&>>
This was an awesome purchase in great condition! Not a flaw. My WiFi just could not support what I wanted to do on it. I had to send it back or it would never have been used.
<<&&&&>>
Very satisfied with the ipad
<<&&&&>>
No me quejo del producto. Pero esta increible el ipad. Buena compra.
<<&&&&>>
very veryyyyy gooooooood¡¡
<<&&&&>>
The screen isn’t genuine part.
<<&&&&>>

Came next day after I ordered it. really like it but batter life is poor.
<<&&&&>>
Great product
<<&&&&>>
OK
<<&&&&>>
Very satisfied with product! Practically brand new, have not noticed any issues what so ever.
<<&&&&>>
Great product and is like new
<<&&&&>>
As described perfect condition works like new. Quite the upgrade for me, from iPad 2 and well worth the money.
<<&&&&>>
It is awesome
<<&&&&>>
It,s what I wanted
<<&&&&>>
Camera doesn’t work. From what I read, it has been an issue with this model. Not very happy.
<<&&&&>>
Charger is very slow. Needs original or duplicate model. Not good, another $15 to $20.
<<&&&&>>
Well... The ipad so far working great. like new. unfortunatly the charger didnt work.
<<&&&&>>
The screen had a lot of scratches!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
No scratches. I love it. Can't keep my hands off of it. It's worth the money
<<&&&&>>
Excellent tablet, clean and ready to work or watch tv with

The auto sleep cover stopped working in less than a month
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
im kipping this item
<<&&&&>>
Very fast shipping! I live in New York and received this iPad Air 2 from California in a few days during Thanksgiving week. I also called JemJem's customer service line, and they answered all my questions promptly. Despite a minor scratch on the back, everything works perfectly (I also bought an iPad case, so it doesn't really matter). Overall, great value for the price.
<<&&&&>>
Every thing was ok good seller
<<&&&&>>
Phone they sent me should have been a 256 gb but they sent me a 32gb they false advertise what memory it has just so u will buy the phone
<<&&&&>>
I bought a refurbished iPhone 7 256g unlocked black. It would not charge past 75%. I left it on the iPhone charger all night. In the morning I found it 'hard bricked' nothing would wake it up. I contacted support and its been three days no answer. Very poor form.
<<&&&&>>
Specifically ordered the black and received gold. Not total happy with white face frame but Decided since i have it in case I would keep it after I tested all functions. Phone worked fine and battery charged to 100% and successfully restored from backup.
<<&&&&>>
It took me a while to get used to the bigger screen vs a 5c but it is as advertised. It has a better camera and battery for sure. No real issues with it. It is a better deal than buying a brand new phone and I can't tell much difference
<<&&&&>>
The exterior is clean and free of scratches. Battery condition is 79%.
<<&&&&>>
wrong item was and very disappointed with that.
<<&&&&>>
daily use
<<&&&&>>
Return it. Never was able to activate with my phone service.
<<&&&&>>
It don't work
<<&&&&>>
This is a Verizon phone. It is also a locked phone. I use Straight Talk and have purchased phones on Amazon with no problem. This phone is not compatible because it is NOT an UNLOCKED phone. When you insert a SIM card in it, in the upper left-hand corner it states VERIZON WIRELESS. Also, I googled the IMEI number (35 921707 531228 7) and the search results look to be that it is also an international phone and not compatible in the US.
<<&&&&>>
Because of the country I live in it is even too hassling to return it so I have to just sit and fester with the wrong item! Luckily the person I am buying it for isn't fussy but if you are BUYER BEWARE!!! The phone quality was very good otherwise and the storage capacity was as stated. Came with a charger, a plastic screen protector which is best replaced with a useful one and simple black snap case which does nothing to protect the phone. Instead of those things I would have preferred it at least come with the lighting/3.5mm jack converter or the earpods but nah. If you're going to order this, I hope you're not too fussy about which model iPhone or colour you're getting cause it's clearly up in the air. Edit: 2 months later after the person whom I gifted this to started to use the phone, it couldn't hold any charge. Turns out the battery was defective. It was constantly swelling to the point the phone split in two. Brought it in to a technician in the nick of time and even caused a small spark while being fixed in the store. Absolutely DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. THEY CLEARLY CANNOT OR DO NOT REFURBISH PHONES.
<<&&&&>>
Lots of issues with this phone even after tons of updates and setting changes. Some letters have to be hit 3-4 times before they’re recognized and type; frequently shuts down without notice. Always needs to be re-started. Waste of money and time. Will not buy again.
<<&&&&>>
Only had it for a week but work great so far and in very good condition. Beats paying near a $1,000 for a new phone and 256gb is great for allowing you to install/store anything you want.
<<&&&&>>
It was delivered in another color with broken Home button and vibration mechanism. The appearance wasn't like new, but dirty. The protection layer was poorly fixed and unproperly sized. Battery and other functions are ok. Overall it is sad experience, hope it happens not so often...
<<&&&&>>
So far the phone is amazing! Looks brand new. Screen is in perfect condition! Very happy with this purchase. I use it with straight talk. Getting it running on straight talk was a breeze! UPDATE: seems to be having some mic/hearing issues. Sometimes I can’t hear a call and others can’t hear me. Starting to get disappointed!
<<&&&&>>
Ordered 256 gb but received 128, gave me options to resolve in a timely manner and all is well. Condition was solid a few nicks n dings battery life at 90%. Smooth sailing so far. Came unlocked went thru Metro by T-Mobile and paying 50 flat unlimited plan satisfied thus far. Thank you.
<<&&&&>>
I got my phone for my mom who lives in the Philippines. We put her local sim card in and it worked perfectly. The phone works like new. Battery life is excellent. Screen is good, camera is good, everything about it is good.
<<&&&&>>
Looks new. Performs like new. Much less cost than new.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is great. Perfect condition and battery. Would highly recommend if you don't want to spend 1k on a phone.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this phone as a gift. It arrived sooner than expected, looks and functions like a new phone, and was a great value. I am more than pleased and so was the recipient.
<<&&&&>>
Este producto no está nuevo tiene muchos raspados, como si alguien ya lo uso
<<&&&&>>
It’s apple quality
<<&&&&>>
What a piece of crap. I spend as much time troubleshooting this $300 phone as I did a $10 android phone. I’m very disappointed and i!and I’m only like two weeks past the ability to return the damn thing
<<&&&&>>
Quality refurbished phone. Looks and works like brand new. Far exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much.
<<&&&&>>
Bad iphone
<<&&&&>>
I have my phone almost a month now. So far it is just as new. Camera is great , battery life is surprisingly good so far.I am enjoying it and I hope it serves me for a longtime.
<<&&&&>>
Came in PERFECT condition. A tempered glass was already on it when I received the phone which helped out!
<<&&&&>>
Hola mi iPhone por qué si pone loco al usar cuando está cargando . Gracias ..?
<<&&&&>>
The phone has 2 spots on the screen,speaker sound distorted
<<&&&&>>
So far, this phone is great. Does the job.
<<&&&&>>
thanks for putting these renewed iphones for sale, well worth!
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my husband and it has been wonderful it was totally unlocked for my Sprint network and it’s been great so far he’s only had it for about a month but everything‘s perfect. We love it!
<<&&&&>>
This iPad is very slow. Almost useless for my 10yo gaming needs. Also never received the case in the picture. Not sure if it said it supposed to come with it or not in the description. The case is not a big Concern.
<<&&&&>>
My apple iPad 2 MC987LL/A Tablet was pre owned so I can't do anything with it unless I find previous owner to delete their account. I am humbly asking if there is anyway you can help find owner or replace my iPad...
<<&&&&>>
iPad looks and works like new!! Love it!!
<<&&&&>>
Works great, looks like new. Bought for my Mom, it’s her first tablet. She is getting used to it and likes it.
<<&&&&>>
Charger was broken. iPad cannot be activated with cellular plan.
<<&&&&>>
Device works well. Battery drains pretty quickly is the only downside. 5 stars on other features and appearance
<<&&&&>>
This iPad was like new! Good price and runs great. I already had iPad Air 1st gen but needed one with unlocked GSM. This looked great right out of box. I set it up, upgraded software, got pre-paid GSM service established, got case and screen protector on, and I couldn't be happier. Seller was great about sending an offer of assist with setup if I needed it. Fantastic purchase!
<<&&&&>>
I was very pleased with it overall. Absolutely no dislikes so far.
<<&&&&>>
I like my Apple iPad Air computer. it's light weight and works perfect.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t know Understand about my card gift .is for what?
<<&&&&>>
The iPad is in excellent condition and performs as expected
<<&&&&>>
as i turned it on this is what came on the screen... DONT WASTE ur money buying this!
<<&&&&>>
The batter on this iPhone 7 only last for 1 hour. Just received the phone yesterday. Apple wants $49.00 to replace the battery. This battery needs to be replaced. Product purchased from Amazon from Kanga Supply. Very VERY DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE.
<<&&&&>>
I gave my son my iPhone 5, he's 6 years old so, he was just happy to have a phone of his own. I purchased the 7 for myself & because I had looked everywhere for a red iPhone 7, finding it on here for under $300 made me buy it right away. Everything works perfectly, no laggy animations, no problems with the charging or battery & it came as if it was brand new. Good job Amazon!!!
<<&&&&>>
Phone body has much scratches and back cam lens is cracked. Eat speaker was not working as well.
<<&&&&>>
This is a great phone and I am more than pleased with my purchase! I was a bit hesitant to buy a refurbished phone but wasn’t able to buy a new one when I dropped and shattered my iPhone SE. So glad I went with this option!!! I feel like I still got an upgrade. The phone works as it should and arrived quickly.
<<&&&&>>
Nunca recibí el producto
<<&&&&>>
Works like brand new, was expecting something wrong with the screen or battery or the phone itself being slow but it works as if i had just bought it from the apple store. Amazing quality!
<<&&&&>>
I like the color but the phone size could be bigger. The charger lasted only 2 days before it stopped charging my phone. Please improve your charger.
<<&&&&>>
Worst❗😩😩😩Ruined my son birthday. Couldn't unlock the phone👎🏾
<<&&&&>>
I gave 1 stars because it looked flawless. Would be nice if my daughter could use it for a phone though. I have metro service and description says compatible with them but metro says its NOT unlocked and gives them an error message that its linked to another subscriber. I emailed the company and would definitely adjust review if they are helpful in figuring out what is wrong but as of right now I was sold a locked I phone!
<<&&&&>>
SCAMMER. It does not work at all. And it is damaged a lot. The only thing you can see is icloud login page which is the first one. That’s all. Nothing works. And they deducted the cost to refund even thought it is because their fault.
<<&&&&>>
No issues!
<<&&&&>>
The back side of the phone has many scratches and not clean at all Very disappointed
<<&&&&>>
It is a phone.
<<&&&&>>
When we received the battery needed to be changed so I had to take it to Apple and spend $40 on a new battery
<<&&&&>>
Fully functional legit iPhone 👌🏽 Red looks amazing
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in a cheep box with a cheep charger and no head phones ,even though pitcher showed head phones with the phone.Other than that... phone looked brand new.
<<&&&&>>
It's not the phone in the picture and I didn't realize until it was already being shipped.
<<&&&&>>
GREAT PRODUCT
<<&&&&>>
skeptical about the reviews but it is everything i wanted and it came 2 days early mayb just lucky no problems
<<&&&&>>
The phone was intact but the box destroyed as well as the screen protector. Little screen shards were all throughout the package.
<<&&&&>>
Unaware phone came WITHOUT a sim card. Not a very good phone when you can't get a number, or call it,.
<<&&&&>>
Dints and scratches
<<&&&&>>
Jdjdj
<<&&&&>>
Paid over 400$ bucks and the damn home button doesn’t work! Bad business!!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
Everything is fine! The battery is just a little less than I would’ve liked.
<<&&&&>>
It doesn’t work properly
<<&&&&>>
New phone
<<&&&&>>
Phone stop working screen went blank.
<<&&&&>>
Muy bueno
<<&&&&>>
everything ok
<<&&&&>>
It didn’t work
<<&&&&>>
Stop woking
<<&&&&>>
I Bought This Phone for My daughter for Christmas, and She was super hyped! It Worked for a couple weeks (I'd say like 2 weeks). But, after those 2 weeks, It started flashing, Blinking alerts, the camera never worked, and Mostly the phone! We Returned and she now has an iPhone 7. It also didn't come with earbuds, or a charger, Which was Sketchy as heck! Would not recommend this phone! (This Was also super sketchy When it asked me for My Sons and Husbands name!)
<<&&&&>>
I wanted the 8 iPhone Red Renew not the 7
<<&&&&>>
My name is Latorya!! I have a YouTube account I would to promote your product from Apple.
<<&&&&>>
So so disappointed today. I spent extra $500.00 at the apple store just to make sure my daughter got a phone that works. The phone sold me wasn’t unlocked, the battery was faulty and the trade-in value was nothing at apple. First and last time I’ll ever do this type of thing.... buying a phone online. It’s just a scam, I won’t advise anybody to do it.
<<&&&&>>
The product complies with the published and very good quality
<<&&&&>>
Excelltnt
<<&&&&>>
Arrived dead, couldn’t get it to work. Phone was in great condition though cosmetically.
<<&&&&>>
Works like brand new
<<&&&&>>
Recibí un Iphone 7 cuando la foto de la compra muestra un iPhone 7 Plus y los accesorios totalmente diferentes a los mostrados
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the phone and it was delivered to my country (Belarus), I have no complaints about the delivery, but after I got the phone in my hands I discovered the following number of problems. 1) I could not turn on the phone. after I spent an hour on the forums, I still managed to do it, but as it turned out, my phone was interrupted and I had to restore it through itunes. t to the problem with the battery did not leave the possibility to complete the upgrade system 2) the battery was just in a terrible state. the phone ranged from 100 percent to 0 percent in 40-50 minutes. It was just impossible. 3) the screen was of so disgusting quality that I could not look at it normally. he had different colors and the maximum screen brightness was very small. For those support, I have a special pretense. they refused to enter my position and the fact that I was unable to send back this device because I was in another country. They gave me only $ 30 for a damaged battery, although replacing the battery in my country's official service costs $ 52, there was no question of replacing the screen. In general, I lost a lot of time to communicate with technical support and did not get a positive result. I lost a lot of money to repair this phone and am extremely not happy with the purchase. If you are reading this message, do not buy a phone from this seller.
<<&&&&>>
My boyfriend and I both ordered iPhone 7s the same day but through different listings. This order was advertised as an Amazon Renewed product which ensured a real, working product. Mine came a day later than the 2-day shipping but I did not mind too much. The package came with an off-brand charger and no headphones but I was not worried about that either. The issue with the order was the actual phone itself! It was actually not GSM unlocked but "Verizon" unlocked. I was so fed up trying to get it connected to my current carrier (over 3 phone calls and two hours later) that I took it to a Verizon store to get connected there. I was not happy to have to switch carriers completely but I was desperate to have a working phone by then. Once I got to the Verizon store they looked at the top left of the screen and said it did seem like a Verizon phone as it says "VERIZON" by the Wifi icons. However, when trying to set up service they ran the serial number and found that this "Verizon" phone was unrecognizable. After I told him this was my THIRD TIME trying to connect this phone with a carrier he advised that I return it right away. It seems I was either sold a locked or a FAKE phone. My boyfriend's iPhone 7 from a different seller works fine, is great quality, and was easy to set up. Do NOT buy from this seller. You will be wasting a lot of time! The one "bright side" is they have immediately approved my return and I will be getting my money back in 2-3 days.
<<&&&&>>
Be mindful: unlocked GSM phones only work with carriers that are compatible with GSM, and unlocked CMDA phones only work with carriers compatible with CMDA. In the US, Sprint and Verizon use CDMA while AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM. Look for an unlocked phone that is compatible with your specific carrier. This phone came in PRISTINE condition with a fresh glass screen protector on it. I have had zero issues with this phone so far. I would highly recommend this to a friend!
<<&&&&>>
Worked great for awhile, then started having issues just before 90 day return rule. FYI...put your refurbished devices through every trial ASAP. Battery won’t charge fully and calls and FaceTime fail.
<<&&&&>>
One of the better refurbished phones I’ve ever bought, clean phone, touch screen and home button work perfect, also didnt expect it to come with a case and screen protector so thats a bonus. Only issue is I thought it would have a new battery installed, says the battery health is around 85% so dont plan on the battery being replaced if you purchase one, other then that No complaints.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with no sign of wear in great condition it looks brand new. 100% functional I’ve had no problem with it all so far and it came with a temper glass too as well so don’t pre purchase one before you get this phone. However, in the settings it says that the overall battery maximum capacity has dropped to 81% since it was first purchased. But I ther than that the phone is great.
<<&&&&>>
Overall the phone looks new. and for a while I was excited but the battery life sucks. I end up charging this phone about 3 times daily. If I go to bed with the battery on 25% , next morning it’s about 10%. Do not buy this phone it’s a waste of your money
<<&&&&>>
Love it It’s working great
<<&&&&>>
Seems it is not unlocked... Sent email to support and looking forward for their reply....
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I have completely fallen inlove with this phone. It came all brand new, with no single scratch or dent. The battery life was at 97%. I love this phone. The packaging was also convenient, delivery time was exceptional.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this phone in March of this year. I have always trusted Apple products. But, on July 20th I had my last phone call. Everything works except I can't hear the caller and the caller can't hear me. I worked with Apple support 3 separate times!! Apple support suggested taking it to an Apple authorized repair at which time I did. We reset the whole phone, installed new sims card but they said it is unrepairable!! Never again, will I buy a phone from this company again!! 279.00 down the drain!!! SMH
<<&&&&>>
Obvious signs of very rough usage of the phone, chipped front screen (not big, but enough to notice) near right side speaker. The speaker on the right was not working at all. Cosmetically it looked fine, however the accessories are duplicate ones, and worried that the phone will say: accessories not supported. The charging adapter looked very very cheap, and cable says made by iqiyi, and probably they will go bad soon, as I have experienced those issues with not genuine charging cable previously. For genuine apple products: adapter costs 20$, lightining cable 20$, lightining to 3.5 mm jack 9$, earpods with lightining connectors 30$. With all those missing, even without the defective speaker, I don't think this is a fair deal.
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone and it would not open. It said it needed an update. I was not able to log on with my SIM card or just log on to my wifi to be able to do an update. I was on the phone with Tmobile for 40 minutes trying to figure out how to get it to work. No success had to send it back. I am most UPSET because I had to pay shipping to send it back. I am waiting to hear from them whether or not they are going to reimburse me for the shipping. Simply not fair that I would have to pay shipping for an unusable phone.
<<&&&&>>
Esta lodo gracias me gusta mucho gracias muchas gracias
<<&&&&>>
I've waited a bit to give a review because I have never purchased a renewed/refurbished phone before & was a little concerned that I may be buying someone else's problem. However, that has not been the case! This phone was just as described - no scratches, dents or any other problems. It is working great and I'm so pleased with my purchase. The delivery was prompt and the packaging was great. Thank you!!
<<&&&&>>
The ear speaker did not have full volume and could hardly hear any of my phone calls. The screen was slightly cracked when it arrived. Also, it would not hold phone service and my phone kept going in and out of service and wouldn’t read my SIM card
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived pretty quick and it came in the original box with the normal accessories and inserts. There was no issue when I went to T-Mobile to activate the phone. I will admit, I was nervous because of the reviews, but I have not had an issue with the phone since it’s been activated and that was 4-5 days ago.
<<&&&&>>
as described easy transfer from old phone
<<&&&&>>
Very happen. Phone looked brand new. Was fully unlocked. Battery health shows as 100% in settings. Good value for a quality renewed phone.
<<&&&&>>
La peor inversión que he hecho, el iPhone venía Con las dos salidas de audio dañadas y en una caja que parecía como si la hubieran sacado de la basura ni de iphone era, venía golpeado y rayado y lo peor es que cuando me llego me encontraba en Estados Unidos ahora estoy en Costa Rica y el proceso de devolución es mas complicado, la peor experiencia no recomiendo la tienda para nada y no se como Amazon puede certificar una tienda así.
<<&&&&>>
Would've been nice to actually come in an apple box. It did have a screen protector already installed which was nice. The charger was generic.
<<&&&&>>
Battery is degraded to 75% after less than a month of use and baseband chip coming detached from motherboard; no cellular function all at this point. Have reached out to seller for repair or return/refund.
<<&&&&>>
The battery doesn’t hold a charge like it should. It also states this under battery health. I’m concerned that we won’t get a full refund because it states they use “software to test for claimed defect” and for all I know their software won’t acknowledge the reason for this return. We should not have to pay a restock fee at all. Will update, hopefully they do the right thing and give us our full refund.
<<&&&&>>
Very clean. No visible scratches, dents or damage. The battery doesn't seem to last as long as a brand new iPhone but that is to be expected. According to the Battery Health monitor on the phone the battery should be able to hold 85% of its original max charge which is pretty good. Overall very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
The battery life is 77% !! Its bad . Also , the cover of it is not clear 100% it has some scratch
<<&&&&>>
Bueno como bueno
<<&&&&>>
So far so good. My son has reported no problems and likes the phone. It was in great condition.
<<&&&&>>
This product was purchased for my Great-Grandson that are in elementary school, and at the present the phone is working fine. I hope that the phone last past it warranty.
<<&&&&>>
Recalled version of iPhone 7. Stopped working after less than 1 week. Could not receive cellular signal so could not send or receive calls or texts. This is the main office phone for our business so our office was down for a day while we had to buy a different phone. Lost business and the $200 cost of the phone
<<&&&&>>
came in mail fast clean phone no scratches glass screen protector put on apple charger great battery life loud speaker
<<&&&&>>
The screen malfunctions. It quits responding to touch in certain areas of the screen and then stops responding entirely. It also spazzes out and starts typing letters I haven’t typed and opening/swiping things I haven’t done. It’s very on and off and hard reset usually fixes it, everything else is perfect.
<<&&&&>>
Todo bien
<<&&&&>>
I look new which is good but it came late and the case it came in was shattered but it works fine
<<&&&&>>
All is good
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived with a crack across the entire top part of screen, and multiple scratches all over the rest of the screen.
<<&&&&>>
Received the phone and home button and keyboard was faulty... You can get around using accessibility option but the fact that this was completely left out of the description is unacceptable... returning product
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit sceptical in buying a refurbished phone but will certainly buy again from this supplier. The phone works well and came without a scratch looks new.
<<&&&&>>
This phone was not unlocked like promised.. took it to 2 different services for them to tell me it’s locked .. it’s only good for at&t (the most expensive service) this was false advertisement !!!
<<&&&&>>
Great item for the price
<<&&&&>>
very happy with my iphone works perfectly thanks
<<&&&&>>
Nice item for a gift
<<&&&&>>
I've had for 2 months now and it works great! Thank you
<<&&&&>>
Got here on time, great product but where I insert SIM card it’s broken as in where you use the SIM card opener a piece of it is missing other than that it’s a great product. Battery life could be a little better.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect for my 10 year old. she loves it. works perfectly.
<<&&&&>>
Does not work with my carrier and does not say this on phone description.
<<&&&&>>
Muy bueno pero me gustaria k le den mas vida a la bateria
<<&&&&>>
Exactly like as described, like new very pleased !!!
<<&&&&>>
Seriously so happy about my phone love love love it and I got it the very next day after I ordered it!!! So pleased
<<&&&&>>
I was looking to upgrade my 5s and at first I was skeptical about buying the 7. But it came in perfect condition and was worth the money! No scratches or dents even though it’s used.
<<&&&&>>
Phone battery tested bad also would not receive single had test by local phone and computer repair,shipped back as instructed by Amazon hope to be reimbursed
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with a battery that had only 52% max capacity. Would hold a full charge for about 2 hours before it would shutdown. I would think if you “refurbish” a phone you would replace the battery in it if it was in that poor of a condition.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone. No issues.
<<&&&&>>
It’s only been a few days and the iPhone won’t charge, really disappointing I want a new one
<<&&&&>>
It’s absolutely worth it
<<&&&&>>
Excellent conditions, with screen protector & everything working perfect. Works with Metro PCS.
<<&&&&>>
This was not simply a low cost iPhone, it is essentially a defective smartphone. It has a glitchy digitizer screen that scrambles and does a bunch of crazy things every time I touch it. So much so I cannot even use it sometimes.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is not GSM unlock. False advertisement. Am not able to use my T-Mobile SIM card. I don’t know if it was just me who receive a false information, but am really upset right now,
<<&&&&>>
It’s thee best iPhone I’ve had yet. I thought the 6 Plus was great, the 7 is better
<<&&&&>>
It took me three times to get a refurbished phone that worked well. This iPhone 7 is solid for the price.
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived in new condition. It was well cleaned and my wife has not found any flaws or issues with it. This was a great experience and we saved a lot of money.
<<&&&&>>
Estoy conforme con la compra, excelente articulo, ese iphone fue para mi hijo ahora tengo que ordenar uno para mi, el 7 o el 8 plus
<<&&&&>>
Got to replace my damage phone. Up graded from a 6 . Love it works great. It would of been nice if it came with headphones. The ones I have no longer work with this phone so I had to buy new ones.
<<&&&&>>
As advertised
<<&&&&>>
Great for kids
<<&&&&>>
The phone came with a battery needing to be serviced. I am still ok with the phone but this should have been disclosed
<<&&&&>>
Was sure what to think buying a renewed phone online. The phone is working great! Saved 200.00 going with a renewed 3rd party VS a renewed provider recommendations.
<<&&&&>>
The product came defected
<<&&&&>>
Great deal!
<<&&&&>>
My screen Freezes up and black out
<<&&&&>>
I bought this for my daughter. She says it’s the best.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect cellphone, looking like new and working perfect through Metro-T mobile. I just had to call the customer service for activation and it was a very easy process.
<<&&&&>>
Buying a "used" Iphone is always risky. This phone is just average compared to the new devices. Let's see how long it lasts. Expensive for the product.
<<&&&&>>
It’s alright. I was expecting better battery life coming from a tank of a phone in my old iPhone 6+. Fingerprint reader acts up sometimes. Camera could be better.
<<&&&&>>
Haven't had the phone but a couple of days but everything seems to work fine
<<&&&&>>
Batteries are no good once you get the phone and don't last. Contacted seller twice with no answer.
<<&&&&>>
Screen to small
<<&&&&>>
Great product!
<<&&&&>>
Its unlocked and scratch less like new phone, battery life is not 100% like new it finish very fast when its below 30%.
<<&&&&>>
Verizon was not able to connect to the phone. They said "It had an internal issue. Something that the iphones are known for having". Im waiting for my refund. Its been several days now.
<<&&&&>>
This phone was misadvertised as unlocked. Per the Apple store it is not unlocked and now I have a very unhappy 16 yr old.
<<&&&&>>
Just have to buy a sim for straighttalk. .99 cents at Walmart. WORTH IT!
<<&&&&>>
I love my phone nothing is wrong with it but it clearly says headphones inc. but there were no headphones at all .
<<&&&&>>
My daughter is happy
<<&&&&>>
Nice
<<&&&&>>
The phone was unlocked and in perfect condition...only thing the charger wasn’t authentic but it’s definitely work the money
<<&&&&>>
So far suiting our needs working fine
<<&&&&>>
Phone camera shutter sound wont turn off... Very annoying and impossible to turn off unless jailbroken.
<<&&&&>>
Great photo everything works fine. Fast shipping.
<<&&&&>>
Did not work!!!! Not made for Verizon
<<&&&&>>
Un desastre, lo devolvi
<<&&&&>>
It’s new and works well, thank you
<<&&&&>>
The phone works almost perfectly, the only issue is the battery life (it doesnt last long)
<<&&&&>>
Great phone ! Even though it’s used ! Battery does go down quick but charges fast
<<&&&&>>
En perfectas condiciones, la batería se termina más rápido de lo normal, nada más
<<&&&&>>
Todo súper bien el producto nítido como nuevo totalmente recomendable
<<&&&&>>
Esperaba el teléfono para hacer un regalo de cumpleaños y no llego
<<&&&&>>
Fue devuelto y aún no me contacta para pedir otro ó devolverme mi dinero
<<&&&&>>
Terrible phone died in 5 months worst purchase I’ve ever made
<<&&&&>>
It wasn’t compatible with any WiFi and stopped working almost immediately.
<<&&&&>>
No dislikes on this phone I’ve had it for a couple months now n I love it
<<&&&&>>
Great product! Great condition!
<<&&&&>>
The finger print reader was the only thing that worked on this phone lol
<<&&&&>>
Present for my granddaughter.
<<&&&&>>
Everything properly works was kind of skeptical but very satisfied!!!
<<&&&&>>
I like everything about this phone
<<&&&&>>
It’s a good phone for someone who doesn’t like fancy phones
<<&&&&>>
Sent phone back on 12-5-2019
<<&&&&>>
Anda muy bien

<<&&&&>>
It's completely unlocked , it works perfectly,i ordered it with standard shipping and they delivered it two days before I expected!! 🤩
<<&&&&>>
Don't BUY!!! The iPhone didn't work and Amazon tried to help but close the feedback without resolving the issue. They made me contact Apple but is not helping.
<<&&&&>>
PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED. VERIZON PHONE.
<<&&&&>>
This is the best phone I have ever had
<<&&&&>>
Horrible service. Don’t buy any cellphone from this seller. I received a cellphone that doesn’t look good and the camera doesn’t work and make weird sound. The only positive thing is that the cellphone arrived before it supposed to
<<&&&&>>
Bought this a few weeks ago. Looks great (like New) works great like it should . So far I'm very happy. Will update if problem occurs. So far so GOOD !!!.....Fast delivery.
<<&&&&>>
We bought this product approximately five months ago. About a month after we got it, the calling didn’t work very well as you couldn’t hear with it. Now it doesn’t even work at all. The whole phone. Buyer beware
<<&&&&>>
This was for my 12 yr old. We got it on time, put in the sim from his other phone and just had to call metro to get them to register the new phone. It has been a week and worked perfectly so far. it looked 100% brand new, not a single scratch on it.
<<&&&&>>
Karen helped me out a lot thank you
<<&&&&>>
Phone came nicely packaged with a charger and screen protector. It was unlocked and so far so good. No issues with it. My son loves it, minus the fact he did not know he picked out the Rose Gold (looks Pink) but nothing a case can't cover, LOL
<<&&&&>>
Everything on this phone works perfectly....just like brand new! No problems at all when setting it up initially, battery life is outstanding and it has accepted software updates quickly & efficiently. Great bargain! Also made me feel secure since it came with a 90 day warranty.
<<&&&&>>
My teenage son is appreciated it.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent product, quick delivery
<<&&&&>>
My daughter's phone arrived quickly, upon inspection I couldn't find any dents or scratches almost perfect. I popped in my T mobile sim card and so far it's worked with out any issues. I recommend this seller .
<<&&&&>>
Venia perfecto
<<&&&&>>
It works excellent. Like new half the price!!!
<<&&&&>>
Worked great, migrated from older iPhone with NO PROBLEM. works great, sounds great, Updated to latest iOS no problem.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was for my daughter and she seems to LOVE it since I've heard no complaints. It's nice looking and I would buy it again
<<&&&&>>
Items looks good and works fine but it was overpriced, I returned it and bought another one from somewhere else.
<<&&&&>>
Thank you so much its working in South Africa its unlocked thank you seller very much.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent phone like new with all accessories.
<<&&&&>>
Works great
<<&&&&>>
It was a gift for my niece and she is very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
It’s a good price but 2 scratch on side corner.
<<&&&&>>
We bought this as gift for my grandmother. She is very happy. It is in great condition and works great.
<<&&&&>>
Very good
<<&&&&>>
I order the phone for my granddaughter and she loves it.
<<&&&&>>
Best
<<&&&&>>
I'm expecting a brand new looking phone, but the phone I received is obviously used. There are scratches at every corner of the phone, it also comes with an ugly screen protector, which cannot be removed.
<<&&&&>>
Replaced an IPhone 6SE belonging to my granddaughter. This iPhone 7 is exactly what she needed. Very easy to transfer info.
<<&&&&>>
So far so good, it’s good quality and came exactly as described!!
<<&&&&>>
Got a really nice phone for such a affordable price. Works great.
<<&&&&>>
The first unit I got was defective and the supplier replaced it with another. I had to pay part of the shipping to the supplier. The new phone works well.
<<&&&&>>
This item was delivered right on time. It is in perfect shape and works perfectly fine.
<<&&&&>>
Todo bien y entregado en tiempo
<<&&&&>>
Battery life is meh
<<&&&&>>
Thx
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Nice
<<&&&&>>
Boo
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks great but after a month the battery didn’t wanna charge on occasion
<<&&&&>>
Last me me lest than a month photo camara started acting up and i couldn't make calls out.
<<&&&&>>
I love this phone!! Reviews were a bit bias but it works amazing! Came in a white box with an adapter, usb cable and the phone. Runs smoothly & efficiently. 8 month update the phone is still working effectively I’ve had no issues nor complaints.
<<&&&&>>
HONESTLY, i really was indecisive reading some of the reviews on here. Some were great and others not so much. I order my Iphone 8 Plus from "My Wit". It came faster than i expected AND Its like in perfect condition. Works like its brand new, sim card synced perfectly. I have Family mobile which is similar to metro PC etc. If youre going to buy this item buy from MYWIT you wont be disappointed. If i can edit this post ill post pictures later
<<&&&&>>
These phones are registered as stolen. AT&T confirmed and we are contacting authorities to investigate this "seller"
<<&&&&>>
Ordered 2 and one is perfect condition just like new! The other one has 2 small scratches on the side. 1 month after use, the screen on one side is darker... and my boyfriends phone cracked by just being in his pocket. Don’t buy this phone, spend a little more for brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews but it was well worth the money. This phone came in perfect condition. I knew it wouldn’t have headphones as per the ad so I didn’t care. Not an Apple charger but still a charger and as expected per the ad. Looks great, camera is great, Bluetooth works, phone functions like a brand new phone. So glad I went with my gut and purchased it. It also came a day early so that was nice!
<<&&&&>>
Received the phone and took it to AT&T to have them swap the SIM card from my old phone to this iPhone 8+. Couldn't make outbound calls or messages, only iMessages on WiFi. Called AT&T and they said the phone was locked in their system and had been flagged as Lost or Stolen, and they wouldn't unlock it without the original purchaser's consent. Phone un-usable.
<<&&&&>>
This phone works amazing. No scratches or dings when i got it. Only thing was, it doesn’t come with headphones or a dongle. And the charger they gave me was not working at all. I tried different outlets, different power blocks, and even a different cord to make sure it wasnt the phone. So definitely expect to buy ALL your own attachments
<<&&&&>>
Was pretty disappointed as the phone did not come with headphones which is kind of a problem since there’s no headphone jack. I looked to see the details of the purchase however the listing was switched out for a different phone so I couldnt. However looked new. The phone also started showing a blue dot on the screen when using the front facing camera literally a week after getting it
<<&&&&>>
Traveling without any worry of not having any local communication is a great plus having this phone. Just buy their sim card and your done. If you use the USA sim then you will be charged very large (international calls) but if you buy the country (where you are going) sim card (switching your sim card to local sim card) will be a big plus to you.
<<&&&&>>
A steal arrived in perfect tip top condition not a single scratch nothing it looks brand new and the battery life is at 98% literally brand new condition and arrived with a charging cable and wall charger I'm impressed!
<<&&&&>>
This phone is awesome! It came 2 days EARLY and it came with a charger and it came with 38% charge! Now, I read like 100 reviews that it wasn't unlocked, let me clear ALL that up, this phone IS GSM UNLOCKED meaning if you use a service provider such as Metro PCS or T- Mobile or other GSM service providers, this phone will work! Now if you use CDMA network( Sprint/Verizon) it might not work but that is not this seller's fault because VERY CLEARLY STATED in the product description this is a GSM unlocked phone. So don't buy it and expect it to work with CDMA Network and then write a bad review when it doesn't. This phone is certified refurbished through Amazon and it is like a brand new iPhone! Also, if you're switching from 6plus or 6s and below keep in mind that the 7 and up don't have a home "button" per say.. like it doesn't push in so the home button is not broken it just doesn't make that clicking sound the older phones make.
<<&&&&>>
Did not receive the iphone plus i ordered, inside the phone box was only the wall plug and phone cord and a screen protector, if i could rate 0 i would!!!
<<&&&&>>
No wear or tear at all. Packages nicely, and seems to work as new. Will update.
<<&&&&>>
it’s good condition?? broken glass and can’t switch on?? different imei numbers. how??? made return.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is physically fine. It has a software glitch. The screen freezes and might not work for a hour or 2 and starts working. All I want is another phone because I understand things happen. They will not exchange it. 2 phone calls later they said they are sending me return info. 3 days later I have not received it. Do not order from this company. They are 70 dollars more directly from apple and you have no problems. Now I am stuck with a 500 piece of junk.
<<&&&&>>
I've just received the product iPhone 7 Plus Red 128GB yesterday. So far , so good, I'm really pleased with the phone, it came in great condition, except one significant scratch on the apple logo, which is a little bit disappointed, but it's fine. Every function works fine the past couple of days, hope it will last long. I will let you guys know if there are any later issues.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was packaged nicely and phone was in excellent condition. Phone was GSM unlocked which made it very easy to set my service up on it (MetroPCS). Only thing I didn’t like was it did not come with headphones. Still 5 stars tho!
<<&&&&>>
Fast delivery and arrived in perfect shape. Two differences between this and a new iPHone... The Cost! and the word Refurbished. Update... have now bought 3 of them and all were and still are perfect.
<<&&&&>>
The phone looks brand new- not one scratch or dent. It works fast and the battery holds great. It also was fully unlocked and arrived quickly. It came with a brand new iPhone charger too!
<<&&&&>>
I enjoyed the phone for less than four months before it stopped excepting a charge and went completely dead.MyWit will not fix or replace it or refund $! Beware of this seller.
<<&&&&>>
Okay so I admit I was REALLY NERVOUS reading the reviews on here, but I couldn't pass up a price like this, so I took a gamble. This bad boy not only arrived on time, it had not even one scratch on it, and to my surprise it turned on with an 80% charge! Bonus! It arrived with the CORRECT CHARGER! I'm assuming either I lucked out, or whoever was in charge of the refurbishment of these ipads was taking notes on these reviews. The only thing is he ipad needed updated but likely because it hadn't been used in a while, if at all. I honestly could not be more pleased!
<<&&&&>>
Had a couple of dings, didn't include the correct charger (arrived w/ iPhone charger vs. iPad charger), and the battery was stone cold dead. However, upon charging the unit with a real iPad charger, it did appear to take and hold a charge. Not terrible for a $200 savings, so the experience could have been worse. Nevertheless, I'm not sure what's being peddled here is actually an Apple "Certified Refurbished" product. I've purchased "Certified Refurbished" products directly from Apple before, and the standard was definitely much higher. So, the key question is: who exactly is "certifying" these refurbished iPads? I'm confident it's not Apple.
<<&&&&>>
My experience wasn't so great. When I got my iPad, all I wanted was to check it out. I could not because it was dead as a hammer! I plugged it in with the supplied charger, and after five hours it still would not come on. Would not begin the start up. At this point I called Amazon customer service after spending over an hour with the rep, all attempts to get the device going had failed. I was so disgusted I had arranged for a refund. Once I arrived home from work I plugged the device in using the 10 watt charger from my old 2nd generation iPad. Within a few minutes the Apple logo came up and the unit began the set up sequence. I've been using it ever since. My question is this, does Dealfisher not realize they are providing the wrong charger!? I think they do. I have read many reviews since my purchase, and I see many reports identical to mine. Maybe Amazon should consider having a talk with this supplier before continuing to allow their bad business practices reflect on the Amazon name.
<<&&&&>>
My iPad Pro 9.7 arrived on time and in excellent condition from DealFisher. There is one small scratch to the screen, barely noticeable, and no dents to the device. The iPad was well secured in a brown cardboard box, with plenty of foam and plastic wrapping. The iPad was a 15% charge when it arrived, and booted up without issue. One thing to note, the charger that came with the device is NOT an iPad charger. That doesn't matter to me, as I already had one at home anyway. The iPad charged up as expected and without issue with the charger I had at home. The device comes with a 90-day warranty through DealFisher, but as far as the Apple limited warranty, my device's coverage was already expired. Not a big deal, IMO, to save over $100 on the insanely priced iPad Pro both new and refurb on Apple's website. If you are reluctant to purchase a refurb device through Amazon, I encourage you to go ahead. This is a great deal!
<<&&&&>>
I just received my "space gray" iPad Pro 9.7 128Gb WiFi+4G today. It came in a plain brown box, with the protective film on the tablet like you would find on a new one. The charger is a "Sharkk" brand unit. That part is "junkk." The iPad arrived with a dead battery. It didn't have enough power to start. I plugged in the charger, and I was concerned because the tablet didn't seem to be charging. However, I kind of expected that, having read several Amazon reviews. The output is 1A. I switched to my 2.4A powered USB hub that I use to charge everything else. Much better. I left it and went back to work. It was fully charged when I returned. I've been installing all my apps and the iOS 11 update, and I ran some benchmark tests just to watch it annihilate my older Galaxy Tab S. The battery is 85% after all that, so it's good. Before ordering, I was concerned about scratches. Mine is flawless. I inspected it carefully and couldn't find a single blemish. I will just have to buy a stronger charger. So for 445 (with next day shipping), I got a perfect iPad pro that would otherwise be significantly more expensive. I'm pleased with this purchase. Four stars instead of five for the useless charger.
<<&&&&>>
I returned IPad...it would not turn on
<<&&&&>>
Looks great on the outside, but I later discovered a dead pixel. I'll be returning this one and trying again with (hopefully) better luck. My package also came with an iPhone charger which was not sufficient for charging an iPad. Edit: I just received a replacement and it's flawless! Still came with an iPhone charger, but that's no big deal at all.
<<&&&&>>
i got it on time, but it doesn't turn on!!!!!!! i charged it for 3 hours and the empty battery keeps showing up.
<<&&&&>>
[NOTE: This is an initial review, and I'm very happy. If anything changes, I'll update the review later.] I've had both good and bad previous experiences buying refurbished/restocked items at Amazon and elsewhere. It's a risk, and I always make sure I have the option to return the item. This time, it appears I've lucked out, in a VERY good way. I should note that I purchased from the seller "Prime Mobility" and can't speak to whether other sellers are as good. I chose this seller based on the number/percentage of previous positive reviews. I debated whether to buy this iPad Pro via Amazon Renewed. I was a little worried about some of the problems previous buyers mentioned in negative reviews (for all sellers). But in the end, the HUGE cost savings were worth possibly being inconvenienced by needing to return a bad item. I bought the iPad Pro 9.7" with the additional cellular functionality AND the 256GB hard drive. These same specs currently cost $700 through Apple's official Certified Refurbished Program (and they don't have the Space Gray color I wanted). I was able to get it here for under $400, which was insanely low and worth the risk. The item arrived in a generic brown box (not Apple-branded), but was very professionally packed and protected. I didn't know what to expect, but honestly was really, pleasantly surprised. If I hadn't known it was sold as refurbished, I wouldn't be able to tell it wasn't new. It didn't look just acceptable or good: it looked actually brand new, as if I'd gotten it from Apple. No scratches, dents or even dust/fingerprints. It's fully possible this was an Open-Box item that has never been used, and was just repackaged. It even came in the same custom, form-fitting plastic packaging sleeve Apple uses, which increases my hunch it's never actually been used. Maybe I just got lucky, but I'm not complaining. The ONLY small negative was that it came without any initial charge, and a correct but unimpressive third party charger, but that's NOT a big deal if you're saving over $300. When I placed my order, I'd also spent $15 on a very high quality Anker charger and cable, so was prepared, and just charged it for a couple of hours before set-up. Reviewers complaining so much about the chargers need to realize how cheap good replacements are, and that this is a very small matter compared to the massive savings on the tablet. You should always have an extra charger anyway, so just buy a couple of good, cheap spares. Setting up the tablet has gone perfectly, and I had no trouble updating to the newest iOS, using the fingerprint sensor, setting up wifi or installing my cellular data SIM card. Everything seems to work perfectly (I checked every function to be sure), and it runs like an iPad straight from the factory. For all intents and purposes, I now have a a tablet indistinguishable from a NEW iPad Pro or a certified refurbished one from Apple. I'll update this review if any problems arise in the next month, but so far the item has me confident this won't happen. I'm very glad I took the risk of buying this refurbished/renewed, and was able to get the tablet for a huge discount.
<<&&&&>>
This is NOT a PRO. It's a normal iPad. Meanwhile, it works fine..just not as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
The screen was cracked and the phone did not turn in after 24 hours of charging.
<<&&&&>>
It is not a Refurbished iphone, it is activated
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone and this is my first picture with the back camera and also when Im tapping look like multitouch. There is any possibility to change the phone?
<<&&&&>>
This product is falsely labeled as unlocked, it's been 4 weeks since I informed that the phone was still locked and all I get are excuses. Plus, the phone came in a really bad condition, so many scratches you can see them very clearly.

I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price) trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could
<<&&&&>>
I loved how new this phone looks and works. Everything works and the battery life was at 94% which is very good. I am very glad with this purchase and definitely recommend buying from them. Very skeptical before buying but now having the product it is definitely worth a buy if you are looking for a good phone.
<<&&&&>>
Soy de Costa Rica, Compre el X de 256, la verdad estaba algo nervioso por ser reconstruido, pero lo recibo ( un dia antes de lo previsto), y considero que este es el mejor negocio que se puede hacer, la bateria esta al 100%, pantalla intacta, funciona de maravilla, es como comprarlo nuevo de Apple.
<<&&&&>>
Phone is basically New, everything works, no scratches or anything, fast delivery. Very satisfied !!
<<&&&&>>
The phone was reported STOLEN AND WAS SHUT OFF BY ATT. THIS SELLER IS A SCAMMER. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Straight out of the box the phone had A LOT of scratches both on the screen and back of the phone. Pretty disappointed, knew the phone was coming at a discount but it’s basically already ready for a screen replacement. The phone itself is super glitchy, can’t even sign in to my WiFi on the next screen. It also does not come with any original box nor headphones. One after market, cheap phone charger included.
<<&&&&>>
Love Love Love it came in perfect condition and it works perfect❤️❤️❤️❤️
<<&&&&>>
Battery dies in one hour in 3 months.
<<&&&&>>
all right, phone is new, I recommend them, thanks
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great
<<&&&&>>
My phone can't be enabled. How can I contact you?
<<&&&&>>
The device doesn’t support LTE plus poor housing box it arrived in. Other things works fine. Breakdown of the price is necessary for what I received 🤕
<<&&&&>>
My iPhone 5S performance was deteriorating and I decided to upgrade by getting this phone. I have Straight Talk by TracFone Inc. a GSM carrier, and received a refurbished iPhone X that was from Verizon and was able to insert my SIM card without any interruption of service. The only noticeable wear and tear on the iPhone I received was some marks that are barely noticeable on the touchscreen. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide if they should purchase this phone.
<<&&&&>>
The screen of the iPhone has a lots of scratches. I removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen. Refurbished means that product has been renewed, so a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated given the high price tag!
<<&&&&>>
I got the phone it came it a sketchy box and only with a charger and some paper. with a funky wrap around it. I got it out and it barely had any charge on it so I had to charge it before setup. once I got halfway threw the set up it turned black and said it was to to hot to function when it defiantly wasn't hot at all this was very disappointing. over all, after set up its a nice phone just couldn't get over the repetition of the same problem and so I had it refunded.
<<&&&&>>
Estimados el celular que compré no está liberado no puedo usarlo
<<&&&&>>
I have had the phone for several days now. Everything functions perfectly - camera, battery life, speakers, face recognition, etc., and it looks brand new. I read several reviews that mentioned that you can’t turn the camera click off - no problem here. And there was no issue getting it set up with our service provider (Sprint). When considering buying this phone based on reviews, consider a few things: this is hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying one new, Amazon’s return service is impeccable so if worst comes to worst, just return it and get another one, and also consider the fact that on average only roughly 10% of people even bother writing Amazon reviews and that a majority of the people leaving 1 star reviews probably wouldn’t have written a review at all if everything checked out like this phone did (I almost forgot to write a review myself). Then consider the fact that a majority of reviewers gave the phone 5 stars and you begin to see how if you’re interested in saving money this is an excellent route as you’re not likely going to do much better than this for the money.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great. However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera. As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!). Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference. TLDR: nice phone, in great condition, good price, came on time, but this particular phone is unusable for anyone who likes to take pictures
<<&&&&>>
This phone would not activate on the Sprint Network. Does not appear to be fully unlocked, despite what it says in the description.
<<&&&&>>
The item came exactly as describes so there is no complaints! The battery life span was at 92% when it came so hopefully that’s good. Everything is working great! The phone is in good condition with no flaws. However, it doesn’t have as long as a battery life as my old iPhone 7 does and it runs out of battery much quicker. BUT that may just be the iPhone x itself and it is as expected since it’s more complicated than the iPhone 7 so it may need to use up more battery life. I don’t really know. But other than that the phone is really good and I would definitely recommend this seller.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone X I received was in pretty good condition considering it's a used phone that is made purely or glass, Battery was at 86% life span which is good considering the phone is 2 years ago, almost $400 off retail and it feels just as fast as an iPhone XS, well worth the money.
<<&&&&>>
I ordered this iPhone for my wife. I got the product and the moment I took the phone in my hand, I could find the Siri button felt little different/loose than my existing iPhone X(which I purchased brand new a year back). Also noticed a major scratch on central frame which would have caused original display damage. Also I could totally see that the display was replaced and the sealing glue was oozing out from left upper side of display. Such kind of phone would not stand against water spills. It took me just 5 mins to figure out the product I was delivered was horribly repaired. I didn’t expect this from Amazon! Very very disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
This item is claimed to be a "functioning like new" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail. I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true. As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into "settings" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck. As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head. I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry* a bride from this father-in-law. Happy phone hunting!
<<&&&&>>
Really nice phone, small Minor scuffing by the power button but it’s in excellent shape. Worked great going from older iPhone SE on T-Mobile. Took out SIM card and put in new device and worked automatically.
<<&&&&>>
No se prende el cel y está súper mal estéticamente quiero que me devuelva mi plata 😩
<<&&&&>>
My boy is pleased
<<&&&&>>
Lovable 5 stars. Works perfect 🙏😁
<<&&&&>>
4/29: Wow! I really thought that this could go south, however, once it arrived it was working as a brand new iPhone, luckily I had a key to open the SIM tray, otherwise I would have had a hard time finding a way to open it. It's been now almost 3 weeks since first started to use the phone and not one trace of a damage or defect has been found and I like all of the features it includes. Kudos to the seller Electronic Deals who sent this one like new and made me happy for the upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone X. UPDATE 6/9: This phone has not failed at all since first use, the only detail is that when you turn it back on, unless it is plugged to the charger wire, it will take a lot of time to boot up, other than that, there are absolutely no complains for this product.
<<&&&&>>
THey claim it includes an ‘OEMA/C Adapter & Data Cable’ but you do not! You get a cheap china adapter and cable.
<<&&&&>>
Estuve leyendo las opiniones de quienes habian comprado antes este teléfono, y no me convencia, pero lo decidi y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra. Llego dos dias antes de lo anunciado por paqueteria. En muy buenas condiciones, la bateria con 98% vida util sin un solo rasguño, como nuevo, funciona muy bien y lo estoy usando en mexico con la compañia telcel, hasta ahorita todo funciona bien lo tengo desde hace 7 dias.
<<&&&&>>
Terrible. Screen completey does whatever it wants goes crazy and doesn’t let you have any control.
<<&&&&>>
Got exactly what I ordered, came with the phone and a charger. Arrived before expected and put a huge smile on my son's face on Christmas morning. Works fine with cricket wireless.
<<&&&&>>
Gets hot when I’m listening to music or watching a video
<<&&&&>>
Phone was a gift for friend they are very pleased with iPhone x
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit hesitant to order this phone because I've never ordered a phone from a retailer instead of the company itself. It arrived on the date predicted and I've had it for about three weeks now. It showed up in a plain white box in a bit of a dirty envelope but the phone itself was fine, it didn't have any scratches or dents or anything. Managed to set it up with my service provider that same day. It turned up with about 20% charge, a charger, and a SIM card pin. I recommend order headphone jack adapters or lightning headphones before you get this phone, if this is your first time using an iPhone like me. All things considered, a good purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Excelente opción. Buen celular, el mío salió perfecto, sin rayones. Buena batería, por la mitad de precio de uno nuevo. El cargador no es original y sin audífonos. Excellent option. No scratches in the screen, good battery and for half of the price of a new one. No original charger, no headphones.
<<&&&&>>
I’m not going to lie, reading the reviews i was really sketched. To me it seemed like there was a 50/50 chance you could get a bad phone. But I can only speak for me personally and it’s an almost perfect phone that I recieved. Not a single scratch and even came with the glass screen protector on there. The battery was at 91% which I wasn’t fond of but if that’s all that’s wrong with it, I’ll take it for the price. But I went in with the mindset that if I get a bad one, I can just keep sending it back till I get a good one, but the one I got is almost flawless. I love the phone. So don’t pay attention to the reviews, it’s a great phone and hey, if you get one that’s not in great condition, Amazon is great at returns. (I’m actually writing this review from the new phone now.)
<<&&&&>>
I am skeptical when reading thru all the comments, but since my Nexus 6 is so slow and laggy, I decided to buy it anyway. I did a research and saw BuySpry has good review so I gave it a chance. It has been almost 1 month since I have it, and it is wonderful, running very smooth. It has a little scratch on the screen but it is acceptable for an used iPhone. My phone came with 95% battery health which is excellent. No complaint so far. POSITIVE and HAPPY with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Estéticamente perfecto, funcionó de la mejor manera pocos días y pero luego no reconocía ninguna red móvil. Hice el reclamo y la devolución y recibí a los pocos días un reembolso completo sin objeciones. Vendedor 100% recomendable.
<<&&&&>>
Not compatible with my carrier as listed.
<<&&&&>>
I would not buy a renewed or refurbished phone. I am sending this back with the 90 day guarantee.
<<&&&&>>
We ordered 2 phones. One for my husband and one for me. Husbands works perfect. Mine wouldn’t sync. No matter how many times I tried. So I returned it. Got another one from the same company. This time the screen has a black spot in the corner that won’t light and the screen flickers on and on like crazy while I’m using it. It comes and goes but the corner is damaged for sure. Retuning a second time to try again. Haven’t even gotten a chance to try the camera yet... will post an updated
<<&&&&>>
I am incredibly satisfied! The phone came in perfect condition! It had about an 80% of battery life upon arrival, and the phone synced from my other device smoothly. My SIM card immediately worked once I put it in. The phone came with no scratches at all, looks brand new! I think it’s worth it! The photos are great! The storage is 64g just like I ordered. It came with an adapter, phone charger, and SiIM tray ejecter. UPDATE: Two days later, I found out that I could make calls and receive them just well, but I can’t hear the person on the other line, unless it’s on speaker. Yet, they can hear me just fine. So, I contacted the seller to see if I can get a replacement. I’ll update as soon as something happens.
<<&&&&>>
Please read before buying: My phone has been holding up great after a month of using it. Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won’t turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I’d say that I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it’s a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i’ve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn’t been entirely paid off. Also, their “refurbishments” aren’t really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There’s only one problem that really isn’t that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished. Better safe than scammed.
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for my husband and have absolutely no complaints. Looks like a brand new phone. The only thing to note is that you receive a generic charger and no headphones as you would with a brand new phone. But for the price difference, its worth buying your own headphones. I liked the peace of mind having 90 days to use it to make sure it works correctly. So far it is perfect.
<<&&&&>>
Good value. No problems
<<&&&&>>
Simply amazing. Everything working perfectly, including the charger that is shipped with the phone. Couldn’t be happier. Spending so much money online made me nervous of a scam, but luckily this product was delivered as advertised. No visible scratches, it looks new!
<<&&&&>>
I love the iPhone X, however when I first received I noticed a deep scratch on the phone. I thought It was on the screen protector that came on the phone. Gave me some few minor problems with swiping up mostly annoying till a couple months later. I wake up and pick up my phone and the bottom portion of the phone screen is completely unresponsive. Very upset that I paid a great amount on a phone that has obvious problems, covered up by screen protector. Very deceptive of on part of the seller not to mention the problem. Should’ve bought straight from Apple instead from a deceptive seller with a good a price.
<<&&&&>>
My updated review: (2 stars): Had some issues with the phone. Battery life quickly plummeted to 80% and noticeably discharged faster. Camera lens seems unstable and rattles sometimes taking blurry pictures and video. I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn’t do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might not My initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape. Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear. But there is a noticeable scratch in the display that is visible at greater than 12in distance. [seller offered to replace with another or a $20 rebate]
<<&&&&>>
I would not buy this product again. I received it with a cracked screen. I didn't even use this item because I received it as a cracked screen and immediately decided I no longer wanted it. I would love to be able to review it properly if received without cracked screens so my first impression was not very good. Definitely not worth the money spent.
<<&&&&>>
bad
<<&&&&>>
WOW At first I didn’t trust the sellers because of the reviews BUT the phone I got was perfect. The battery is 97% it’s original state which is awesome. There are literally no scratches or marks ANYWHERE. But it didn’t come in original packaging which kinda sucked BUT ALL I CARED ABOUT WAS THE PHONE AND IT WAS GREAT WHAT A DEAL.
<<&&&&>>
I loved how it took 3 days to get here. The phone is in perfect condition, almost brand new. Doesn’t come with a screen protector like other refurbished phones but no worry I bought one. It came half way charged which was great regarding setup. The speakers work, I received the correct phone 256GB, fully unlocked. Amazing phone, definitely worth the price.
<<&&&&>>
I loved the price of this phone. But you deff get what you paid for. The battery life sucks. The phone glitches when I type and constantly deletes everything I’ve typed without anyway of stopping it. The phone freezes and closing all the apps doesn’t help nor does locking and unlocking it. I’ve tried resetting it too and it sucks too. I waited to give a review to get enough time with the phone to give a better review.
<<&&&&>>
The phone function fine as expected. Unlock and good to use international. The phone I receive got a lot of scratches in the back. However, I use cases on my phone so this doesn’t bother me too much.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone to replace my iPhone 6. The battery life on this does not last as long and it seems to be very glitchy. Sometimes my screen will have various colored lines through it or it gets stuck or frozen for no reason. I assume this is because I bought it refurbished but I should have just gotten it now .
<<&&&&>>
No scratches, works great, would recommend
<<&&&&>>
Got the phone yesterday, beside a little scratch on the front screen, the phone looks great, just like brand new. Batter life is at 89%, this could be better but I’m ok with it. It came with a pre-installed screen protector that it’s a bit wide placed, but it’s a not a issue. The value for the money is 11/10
<<&&&&>>
A few scratches here and there but it works like a charm!
<<&&&&>>
Call
<<&&&&>>
Brand new
<<&&&&>>
Excelente! everything is fine!
<<&&&&>>
Great product. Cheap. Mine looks brand new, battery is amazing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.
<<&&&&>>
I don’t have it set for face or finger print reader. I’d rather just have a password. I love having storage space for all my apps I had to give up because older phone had no space and had to keep deleting them until I only had one. I’m still learning what all my phone can do, and haven’t gotten everything setup perfect yet but I’m grateful to have found this phone. I love it. It takes great pictures.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little hesitant to buy this phone used because you don't really know the exact condition of the phone but when the phone arrived, upon inspection the phone looked brand new, no scratches or anything. It even came with a screen protector probably from the original owner. The phone works great, no issues at all. The only thing I don't like is the lack of the original box and cables. It comes in a little orange box with no brand cables and it did not come with the earbuds. That's not a big problem though as description states that it doesn't and the phone is at least $300 off retail. Overall, very happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Seeing how these reviews are about these phones coming in like hot garbage, I decided to take the risk and believed in the company sending me the phone to give me one that isn't like the others. Believing I did right, seeing how they technically gave me a brand new phone with a 100% battery life and almost no scratches on the screen (probably 2 week old phone that broke). Honestly, if you're feeling lucky this is a way to go. It's 100% worth paying this price since it's technically a steal. However, you risk getting these trashy phones I keep seeing in the reviews. I wouldn't know, but if you ever decide to buy from them, hope you get the one you need.
<<&&&&>>
Everything is basically perfect I really have not bad to say about it I may update if something goes wrong but it doesn’t look that way, super happy
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
I ordered the space grey 256gb iphone x. I got and it is damn near mint. No marks no scratches, even tho it was still on iOS 12 I did upgrade it to iOS 13.2r. I upgraded from a 6s+ and im pleased with the peice of mind from amazon, and not taking a gamble on ebay.
<<&&&&>>
The screen would just go black all the time and it would have these green lines and wouldn’t work for long periods of time. I had to leave it on and turn off the auto 30 second lock just so I could use it. Tried to return it and it came with a small crack on the back of the phone. Can’t return it because I dropped it on accident while packaging it to return. Would never buy another phone from here. I need my phone for work and I was unable to communicate with my coworkers which was an issue when it would turn off without being on the charger.
<<&&&&>>
It comes in a weird box with a crappy charger. It looks like the back had little dents in the glass. Like it had come in contact with sand inside the case or something like that. Apart from that the phone was in good condition, the front glass was smooth, battery capacity is at 91%, i havent had any issues with the phone.
<<&&&&>>
I can say it’s one of the best phone It really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger 🔌 and it’s pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however.....
<<&&&&>>
Lots of mixed reviews. I was worried about what I would see once I opened the package. Absolutely no scratches on the screen or the back of the phone. It came with a screen protector, charger and the tool to access sim card. I had to look real good to find a little wear around the edges of the phone, but nothing extremely noticeable. It was very close to a new phone when it came to appearance. It also came with a full battery. After reading the reviews I guess it is just hit and miss with these phones.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is good, only some light visible scratches on the screen, but the charger is defective, doesn’t work properly. The cable seems to be burnt.
<<&&&&>>
Ordered a 256 GB for AT&T. Product came with minor scuffs on the sides of the phone that were easily covered by a cheap case. IMEI was clean and I just slid in the SIM card from my old iPhone to get signal. Battery life was at 85%. Solid 8/10 quality but well worth the discount over buying new. Will update if any issues arise.
<<&&&&>>
Doesn’t look like new at all. A lot of scratches on screen and the sides. It’s a used phone used by a person with not care (didn’t used a cover or a any kind of screen protection. I’m so disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
Came with charging cable that didn't work phone
<<&&&&>>
Todo había estado muy bien, pero al mes empezó a fallar de la pila, y ahora ya no sirve después de otro mes
<<&&&&>>
Celular excelente los accesorios no son originales
<<&&&&>>
Great iPhone service quick thanks highly recommend
<<&&&&>>
Sim locked to original GSM owner. Original phone owner iCloud locked phone with find my iPhone after I had it for a day
<<&&&&>>
I am so happy with how this phone arrived! It arrived quickly and looks completely brand new. It came with 96% battery life so I was very pleased with that and everything works on it just as it should!
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone I received is in prestine condition and even came with a screen protector already installed. Not a single scratch or scuff mark anywhere on the phone. Literally is a brand new phone. Battery life is at 98%! I’m extremely happy.
<<&&&&>>
Basically a new looking phone at a discount
<<&&&&>>
I have just received this product, and I was excited until I noticed a large, 2 1/2 inch crack on the screen. I have hesitated to turn it on as I am in the process of requesting a return. This review will remain at 2 stars until I receive a refund or replacement.
<<&&&&>>
Renewed, works like new. Came with a generic charger but no issues so far, and it's been a few weeks. No cosmetic damage from what I can see either.
<<&&&&>>
I was a bit nervous buying such a pricey phone refurbished, but I was very impressed. Battery came at 95% health, the device came with a screen protector and generic accessories (which were actually better than what normally is included), and the only imperfection was a small scratch that I hope is in the screen protector but is hardly noticeable. For half the price of the new phone, this was incredible quality
<<&&&&>>
Phone has looked and acted like NEW since day one. Was definitely a risk buying something so expensive refurbished but it absolutely worked out this time. If all the refurbished phones come like this I HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the $400 difference from a new Iphone X 265GB.
<<&&&&>>
I had this phone for only 4 months and it completely broke. I brought it to a football game and it was in my pocket, zipped up the whole time. After the game it just started flashing the apple logo. I took it to a phone repair store and they opened it up and were surprised it ever worked, saying a lot was wrong within. Just pay the money and get your phone from apple/whatever your cell carrier is.
<<&&&&>>
I requested a silver one and got a gray one. Extremely disappointed as nobody reviewed the product and compared it with my original order
<<&&&&>>
As soon as I took it out of the box it wouldn't turn on. It didn't have any scratches or anything but it simply wouldn't charge and therefore couldn't use it. I was very dissapointed because it had such great reviews and I waited so long to receive it.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is an upgrade from my last one and the storage is great, but when I received my phone I noticed scratches on the screen. No big deal, but then I realized they were cracks on the screen and not just scratches. Highly disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
my phone was coming up as lost or stolen when i tried to get it activated
<<&&&&>>
I would highly recommend this product. It’s been working fine so far.. only funny thing is the face recognition sometimes mixes my mum’s face and I.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve been using this phone for 1 month now,I can have any complaints about this phone EXCEPT for the battery health...my current battery is 11%,but guess what,I only use my phone for 3 hours,yet its dying🤢Everything else went super smooth except for battery!!!but still,if u are not a guy who is on his phone for 24/7,then u should definitely purchase this iPhone X
<<&&&&>>
I like that the phone is easy to use. And the phone is reliable.
<<&&&&>>
it come to chance the battery, according to apple the maximum is 500 cycles
<<&&&&>>
I’m loving it! So worth it!
<<&&&&>>
The battery life has no as long..
<<&&&&>>
The phone has issues with the touch screen Am very disappointed with the phone
<<&&&&>>
Great buy ! Works like new and the battery health was 100% when I first got it. It’s at 99% now though. Only thing is the Product came with a generic charger however I’m not too mad about that because I can just buy the original Apple charger but apart from that everything is great . Oh the phone also came with a tempered glass . Worth the cost !
<<&&&&>>
Returned it bc I didn’t need it but it was exactly as described
<<&&&&>>
When I received the iPhone X from BuySPRY, everything worked great. But then after using the phone for 92 days, it shuts down out of the blue and does not power back up. And sure enough, the warranty with the seller ended after 90 days. I took it to the Genius Bar for a diagnosis and they guess it was a bad processor and could not be fixed.
<<&&&&>>
I like that it came nice and clean and even had a screen protector on it. Literally not a single flaw this phone is perfect for the price. Only used for a day battery is good but seems as it charges slow.
<<&&&&>>
Good price, excellent shape. Battery has 87%,left of life.
<<&&&&>>
Can’t say anything bad. Like the phone and haven’t had issues. 90%battery life when it arrived.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived looking beautiful and new, but once we set it up and tried making a call it became apparent that the audio was not functional. I could only hear and be heard when on speaker phone. I was bummed, and I was even more bummed that There was no option to exchange the phone for a working one and I had to return it instead.
<<&&&&>>
My money was well spent! My phone came in earlier than the day expected and it easily transferred my information from my old iPhone to my new iPhone X! The only issue that I’ve noticed was a very tiny crack in the top right corner of the phone (not the screen) which isn’t even noticeable if you aren’t looking for it. Great buy.

The phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, which was neat, and had fade scratches on the back. The stainless steel on the sides has a decent amount of scuffs, which is predictable for its price. But the phone functionality is great judging by the 100% battery life which I am amazed with. All in all it’s a pretty decent purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I would rate this product 5 stars but the front camera came with a little dust and it does influence the definition. The battery takes a bit longer than usual to charge but it's ok. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend the product! It came with a free screen protector :)
<<&&&&>>
iPhone came sooner than estimated. Phone came in perfect condition. Only came with a charger tho. Didn’t get the pin for sim reader but a safety pin works fine if you use it the right way. Phone came with glass screen protector put on already. Do research on who your buying from. I got mine from mastertronics.
<<&&&&>>
Slight scathes around edges of back of phone. Battery life at 93%. Other than those things works like new, super fast and premium feeling
<<&&&&>>
The phone is working great and didn’t come with any scratches or anything wrong with it, everything works well and the battery life is great lasts all day and The company the phone is from is a recycling company so they take phones and fix them. There was no problems.
<<&&&&>>
Súper perfect quelity Excelent love it si fast delivery and good product
<<&&&&>>
Advertisement said completely new screen and no cosmetic defects, but screen is scratched, and I'll have to return this phone. This is extremely inconvenient as I have no phone without this.
<<&&&&>>
Sold us a stolen phone so we couldn't activate it. We ended up returning it and just purchasing a new one through our phone plan.
<<&&&&>>
No obvious dings or dents, simple packaging, off brand charger but that’s okay, best deal out there from the research I did. I’m pleased so hopefully, dear reader, you will be as well!
<<&&&&>>
This phone was manufactured for Japan so you can’t turn off the camera shutter sound! Very loud and very annoying. I never would have bought this phone if I’d known this. There is nothing in description that discloses this info.
<<&&&&>>
It was practically brand new as far as the condition. Only thing was that the battery was at 90% life but its a steal either way. Extremely satisfied. Had iPhone 6+ previously
<<&&&&>>
Not the same phone and it’s bad
<<&&&&>>
The phone is fine. Good shipping, packaging, etc. However, I believe this phone was meant for the Korean or Japanese market as there is no way to silence the camera shutter on this device. US buyers - be wary as these phones may have been made for different markets and are being resold.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is fast and works like new. I wouldn’t have know I got it used
<<&&&&>>
Great phone. Purchased it renewed. Unfortunately had to send it back to the seller since the phone randomly rebooted. The customer service was excellent.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little leery after reading some of the negative reviews. I bought this phone for my daughter and it works great! No issues at all and it looks brand new. It was about $350 cheaper than a new one. Shipped fast too as I received it the next day
<<&&&&>>
Love it, stays up with my busy life
<<&&&&>>
I like it a lot but it seems to be running into a little trouble following my directions and I’ve lost the voice-sound on a couple of the applications. I didn’t think I would need to have it tune up so soon after I got it . But over all I pretty happy with it .
<<&&&&>>
I like but sometimes it starts out ringing normal then goes way low
<<&&&&>>
I like this phone a lot doesn’t even have a scratch on it I’m very satisfied with it. I read the reviews on the seller and that’s why I went with this seller they spoke the truth so far I think I got a good deal.
<<&&&&>>
Impecable, superando expectativas
<<&&&&>>
Ok
<<&&&&>>
Works well and yet to see how the battery behaves over time.....
<<&&&&>>
screen slightly scratched but otherwise satisfied. Love the iPhone X.
<<&&&&>>
It works & that's all that matters
<<&&&&>>
Great phones
<<&&&&>>
Thank you
<<&&&&>>
The phone works with metropcs. Battery maximum capacity is 100% which is really good. Although it’s an amazon prime renewed product, for the price it’s a very good deal.
<<&&&&>>
Me llego como dice el anuncio con dos pequeños raspones que no afectan al uso, a las dos semanas de usar se daño el speaker de oído, espero que no tenga mas problemas. la batería si llego al 94%.
<<&&&&>>
Love
<<&&&&>>
Everything I expected
<<&&&&>>
I am completeley amazed by how new the phone looks. Everyting works perfect, the phone has no scratches, neither does the screen and it even arrived with a glass protector on the screen. I am very satisfied with my purchase!!! Thank you!
<<&&&&>>
Phone WAS not fully unlocked. Will be returning.
<<&&&&>>
Gift
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as promised, in excellent condition and shipped quickly. Thanks!
<<&&&&>>
I went to AT&T to purchase new 11 and decided to go online to Amazon. I’m happy I did! This phone is nice, takes a few days to learn how to use it. I just ordered another for my hubby. Great value
<<&&&&>>
Very good phone
<<&&&&>>
Good
<<&&&&>>
Amazing!!! Flawless phone!!! SOOOO worth it!!! Thanks!!
<<&&&&>>
Great product work like a new phone
<<&&&&>>
Very happy with it.
<<&&&&>>
Sells phones locked to att/T-Mobile yet says fully unlocked in discription.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is great and although it says that it is gsm unlocked, my carrier said the phone is somehow not compatible with it. (My company is Sprint). I don’t understand, gsm unlocked should mean that that it’s able to connect to my provider no?
<<&&&&>>
IPhone x 256gb for $760 it’s a Good price for great brand The only thing I don’t like it came with not original accessories
<<&&&&>>
Still working perfectly
<<&&&&>>
Good Deal, Buyspry customers service is amazing and they really helpful.
<<&&&&>>
Mi iPhone venia con la cámara rota y el micrófono no funcionaba bien, lo devolví
<<&&&&>>
My phone arrived quickly and seems to be almost “brand new.” I could not find any small scratches or sign of exterior wear. The battery life is incredible. I have had the phone for a couple of months now and have not had a single problem!
<<&&&&>>
Easy SIM swap. Took the phone to an Apple store and it passed their diagnostics test. Very good price. Only problem is that it came with an unofficial charger cable and no headphones but that was expected.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in perfect condition. Very pleased.
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as described! My daughter lost her phone in a freak accident. This was the replacement option we decided to try. I'm really glad I did.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in great condition! It was delivered as expected. It also came with a Shatter glass protector on the phone
<<&&&&>>
Great price and excellent condition
<<&&&&>>
Great phone. Was worried about it being refurbished but otherwise is an awesome phone
<<&&&&>>
Worked perfect like if it was brand new out of the box.
<<&&&&>>
Great
<<&&&&>>
I like the product a lot. But I have issues with the camera it’s not as crisp as a real iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is clearly from a foreign country as you cannot turn off the flash. It also has other software quirks. Functions fine but will be replacing in less than a year.
<<&&&&>>
Just what I wanted
<<&&&&>>
Seems all good so far
<<&&&&>>
Que no vino los audífonos ni el cargador original del teléfono
<<&&&&>>
Was very nervous to buy this phone, but couldnt be happier! 100% battery, looks like a new phone
<<&&&&>>
Successful refurbished iPhone!
<<&&&&>>
The phone came and the screen kept glitching out as soon as I start to set up the phone and only got worse with time. Made it extremely hard to do anything like typing or using apps.
<<&&&&>>
I called at&t and apple and of course apple blamed everything on at&t but it’s ok AT&T and cricket and the same thing AT&T owns cricket so the switch should be easy but it going to take some time
<<&&&&>>
I was first scared to buy this product after reading all the reviews but after receiving it looking brand new i was not disappointed. it connected easily to att and now works great!!
<<&&&&>>
Battery seems to go down quickly
<<&&&&>>
Nosotros lo compramos a principio de año y nos funcionó súper bien , en éstos días volveremos a comprar otro celular de éste mismo vendedor ya que estamos muy satisfechos.
<<&&&&>>
Awesome phone, only problem is the battery life isn’t the greatest & it won’t let me completely sign into apple services although I can still use the phone.
<<&&&&>>
Esta muy bien., pero no se le hicieron las pruebas suficientes de que servia., se reinicia solo y habeces se blokea la pantalla por completo., de ahi en fuera todo bien
<<&&&&>>
La traducción en español manifiesta GSM DESBLOQUEADO y resulta q tiene bloqueo estoy fuera de Estados Unidos y no puedo devolver Amazon no me da solución
<<&&&&>>
Excelente
<<&&&&>>
This phone was amazing! It didn’t come in original packing and sealing but it was secured and like new! Now scratches or anything. It even came with a tempered glass
<<&&&&>>
So far, so good.
<<&&&&>>
I just turned this phone on and it has a yellow line down the left side of the screen. I paid alot for this phone. Very disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
I was so disappointed with the quality and felt cheated by both the third party seller and Amazon. Do not buy!
<<&&&&>>
Perfect. The battery life is at 94% which is awesome for a refurbished phone.
<<&&&&>>
Like it for the price, haven’t had any issues with it.
<<&&&&>>
Facial recognition doesn’t work in the dark.
<<&&&&>>
Okay
<<&&&&>>
Hi guys, i really like the phone, but it's giving me hard time,keep freezing and then it says something about charge too
<<&&&&>>
The phone has a crack at the top of the screen. It is small but annoying.
<<&&&&>>
I bought it to my son . But it’s was with a crack between the cameras . It’s never happened with me before buying used iPhone 😭
<<&&&&>>
Very clean. and easy to setup
<<&&&&>>
Phone won't acces internet Amazon help center fed me b.s. for an hour. Totally worthless purchase

I bought a refurbished iPhone that I received on June 24, 2018. On November 3, 2018, while using the phone, I could feel the phone getting way too hot (for no reason), and then it shut itself down. I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days. I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said “too bad, so sad” the warranty is 90 days. So, no, I do not recommend buying a refurbished iPhone, and I especially don’t recommend buying one from this third-party seller (Prime Mobility).
<<&&&&>>
Very pleased with my IPhone X 256 gb great price and great condition, works great with my AT&T SIM card, phone is like brand new
<<&&&&>>
Had two weeks to return it. My original intent was to have a big screen with a phone small enough for my pocket. I read all the negative reviews. It took a few days to learn buttonless mauvering...but I learned it. Facial ID perfect. But for day to day use with no fear of back glass breaking I decided to swap the X for the 7. But at the last moment I decided to keep the ten. It does have the largest screen yet fits in my pocket.
<<&&&&>>
Well this phone is really good went to apple to get it active and the I started to play games call friends and have friends I think it is great
<<&&&&>>
This is my favorite iPhone so far. I do think that  should be further ahead though. I’ve been a bit bored with iPhones when it comes to cool gimmicky features. Powerwise, I’m super satisfied! It is a work horse in your hands, all my programs open up fast with no lag. I’ve also gotten this phone wet on many occasions and it’s still going strong. I got it about a month after it hit stores. I don’t miss the headphone jack because I only use it with Bluetooth devices. For reference, I use Bose soundlink 360 II, Bose Mini, PowerBeats 3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II. They all connect great without a hitch. Some persons must have gotten a lemon. They should take it in to Apple, I’m sure they would exchange or repair your phone if you haven’t had it for more than a year.
<<&&&&>>
Apple told me to take the phone to BestBuy for service after it developed a bunch of lines on the screen. Best Buy tried for an hour to process the return and gave up saying Apple's software wouldn't accept it for service. I went back onto Apple's chat based support. It was in the evening and the person on chat struggled with English. After much back and forth she could not explain the potential charges.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve had my phone for a little more than a month now and it works flawlessly and looked like new when I received it. I was so happy with it I bought my wife another one. It also has been working flawlessly and looked like new also. I have seen the bad reviews for this product and can either say they were unlucky or are making bogus reviews, I am 2/2 and very happy with my purchases. 2 like new phones for about $500 less than new cost. I would recommend this to my friends and family if that helps you with your decision.
<<&&&&>>
Thank you very much, it works excellent and I have not had any problems. Works with At&t Mexico perfectly.
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  I purchased the renewed silver iPhone X and when it arrived, the microphone did not work. I could not record videos with sound, use Siri, or make calls AT ALL because of this. I returned it and ordered ANOTHER silver iPhone X and the screen would glitch. Random movements, swipes, and clicks would go through without me touching the screen. Both phones came from different vendors, by the way. DO NOT waste your time and money on a renewed phone. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a brand new phone that will actually work.
<<&&&&>>
STAY AWAY From APPLE products! When Apple’s Marketing Chief Phil Schiller gave his blessing to the iPhone X, "So if you happen to be hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water... don't worry, dive down, grab it, rinse it, let it dry, you'll be fine.” You would *Think* Apple would stand by its product. WRONG! As it happened to me, I stopped my phone in shallow water, only 3 feet deep, for a few seconds, and IMMEDIATELY my phone bricked. I purchased my iPhone X for $1199 and I would expect my phone would last a few years and have the peace of mind that my phone would still work after that incident. Well I was more than angry when Apple would not even attempt to replace my product, but charges me $549 to replace with a $#%$ refurbished product. The Staff at genius bar were snobby and would not even care! You work hard for you money, you spend your hard earn dollars for a good quality product, but APPLE is only scamming you and stealing from you! THINK ABOUT IT! Don’t buy what they advertise unless they guarantee it! PERIOD!
<<&&&&>>
I wasted over a grand on this phone. I’d had the iPhone 6 before and I wanted to upgrade because I’d heard good things about the camera. I wanted to take better pictures of my kids and figured it would be easier to spend the money on a phone than a camera . Wrong. Marginally better camera. NO thumb recognition. Just annoying and terrible. So disappointed
<<&&&&>>
I was super happy to get this phone when I first got it, everything worked perfectly fine, face ID worked, no scratches or anything... but the when I went up to sprint the next day they said the phone wouldn't work with there service cause this a GMS phone, and it wasn't capable with there service and I was very disappointed… I wouldn't recommend anyone to get a phone that says GMS on it because you have a high chance of the phone not working with any services especially if you have sprint... make it even worse once I got this phone that same day I got my debit card info hacked and had $732 dollars taken out of my bank account. so I wouldn't trust this company to buy phones from... im very upset with this phone and the seller

removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen. Refurbished means that product has been renewedso a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated seriously
<<&&&&>>
This device is unusable for me because the OLED PWM (pulse width modulation) causes headaches and eye strain. The lack of fingerprint sensor became a dealbreaker for me, as the swiping gestures are high friction (effort) and don't register consistently. I returned mine.
<<&&&&>>
I didn’t want to rate it till I was sure . I’m sure. It’s great.
<<&&&&>>
What does renewed mean?
<<&&&&>>
I am so happy with my purchase! The phone is in perfect cosmetic condition, it looks brand new! The phone works great so far, quick and good battery life. It only took three days to arrive, it arrived a day earlier than expected. Great price, great deal! Definitely would recommend this seller and their products, you get exactly what you expect! :)
<<&&&&>>
All of the other reviews saying the 64 gb and the 256 gb are the same price are fake the 64 gb is $660 while the 256 gb is $790.
<<&&&&>>
It’s not a apple product, it’s a clone and at that price schould be apple product I’m. Returning this
<<&&&&>>
Muy buen telefono lo recomiendo
<<&&&&>>
Arrived in perfect condition, and works like new! Super happy!
<<&&&&>>
$900!! That’s the price for a new iphone X
<<&&&&>>
Really like for tween birthday present great for value and price.
<<&&&&>>
I love it! There are however a few scratches.
<<&&&&>>
Aún no lo he recibido, estoy tratando de comunicarme con un respetable y es detestable nadie responde nada
<<&&&&>>
I got my phone two day before it was supposed to be delivered no scratches perfect working condition came with a glass screen protector as well above and beyond what I was expecting
<<&&&&>>
No lo recomiendo..........la pantalla táctil falla a cada rato y hay programas que no puedes cerrar y Siri nada que resuelve
<<&&&&>>
I am really glad for this phone. Thumbs up, I recommend buying it. It’s worth buying
<<&&&&>>
did not come the headset and the charger is not original
<<&&&&>>
This is the best phone ever
<<&&&&>>
Perfecto
<<&&&&>>
I love the phone..
<<&&&&>>
Im so happy with this purchase i hope a nice phone :D
<<&&&&>>
bad!
<<&&&&>>
it was nice!
<<&&&&>>
en duda
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone's water resistance rating is pure garbage. I just drowned two phones in an inch of water within a few minutes. Anyone know of a class-action lawsuit for this?
<<&&&&>>
If you're looking for hundreds of dollars off an iPhone X this is the way to do it. The phone functions perfectly, battery health states it is 96%. Screen is in like new condition. I've always purchased refurb'd products from laptops to tablets to phones. Upon receiving this device I was a little disappointed regarding the description in comparison to the product I received. "The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away" The scratch on the lens that I've included a picture of wouldn't show up very well on my iPhone 6s's camera but I couldn't get it to focus on the back glass of the iPhone X with my horrific barracks lighting. The scratch I can visibly see when the phone is resting on a table in front of me.
<<&&&&>>
I called AT&T this morning to see if this phone can be unlocked and whether it truly came from a non-USA affiliate of AT&T. Mary, the AT&T representative tol me that: A) 250 days remain on the warranty, so phone is about 3-4 months old; B) phone is one of many purchased from AT&T (USA) on a payment plan that was not paid; C) the account used to purchase the phone was closed by AT&T's FRAUD TEAM; D) the phone DID NOT come from an AT&T affiliate, European or otherwise; and E) the phone is subject to being blacklisted for non-payment and *possible* fraud. I provided a copy of my Amazon.com invoice to document that I purchased the phone in good faith. Mary submitted a request to have this phone "cleared" in their system so it won't be blacklisted and can be unlocked. It will take 48-72 hours to find out if AT&T will do this. Apparently, there are a lot of phones like this one being sold on Amazon.com and other online marketplaces. Buyer beware. Do you really want to spend $1,000 + of your hard-earned money only to find out you were scammed?
<<&&&&>>
I’m surprised how brand new looking this refurbished phone is. No scratches or dents. Went to sprint to activate and it just works. Battery I can get a day and half
<<&&&&>>
The phone was in perfect condition!! I am more then pleased with this company. The phone is exactly as described!! I will buy from this company again in the future!!
<<&&&&>>
I received my phone in decent condition but notice after 10 mins using it would over heat then the screen all sudden there be like a glitch just terrible so I returned it
<<&&&&>>
Package came with it some random box. Do note this is not from apple. For my unit, I believe the previous owner dropped it and broke the screen. I have reasons to believe my screen is not authentic. It’s easily scratch. I notice small dent marks on the bottom & at the back of the phone. Battery health is 88% for mine which is sort of disappointing. Take note: -Phone is definitely used -Battery health is not within 90% -small dents -easily scratch on screen -it’s probably not water resistant anymore, if they actually replaced the screen. -no original cable or adapter Overall, it works fine. But I just want to put this out there so some of you will consider it before purchasing it. For the price is honestly ok.
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived three day early. This phone is beautiful and flawless. Battery life is more than I expected. Phone works perfectly. I had to contact customer service through email and they responded to my questions immediately.
<<&&&&>>
When I read some of these reviews I was pretty worried after placing my order, but the phone came in perfect condition with 100% battery life. You would have never known it was refurbished. It does not come with a sim card but I just went to the AT&T store that day and got the phone activated. This is definitely the way to go instead of spending 2-300 dollars more on a brand new phone.
<<&&&&>>
Before purchasing the phone as a upgrade from my I phone 7 , I read all the reviews, then I made one of the the the biggest mistake of my life the phone is a total waste of time , everything is bad about the I phone x , considering it cost me so much money, I believe Amazon should monitor carefully the sale of used phone it's is obvious no one cares. I am certain the previous owner had problems and I brought it on myself, I am so dissatisfied.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition phone. Only bad part about this phone is it is a Japanese model phone certain things you can't do with them .acoording to some reports and testing It has a slower LTE modem, signal strength indoors was not as good .They are programmed a little different. A1902 is the exclusive edition for the Japan market. It covers some LTE bands used only in the country Notice that the phone has a mandatory shutter sound when taking photos.
<<&&&&>>
Package arrived on schedule. The iPhone was nicely packaged in an aftermarket carton. When I opened the package I was surprised at how perfect the cosmetic condition was. Awesome !! I placed the iPhone X on the enclosed charger and the phone was at 85%. It was 100% charged in about 15 minutes. I signed on and was able to transfer all data and apps automatically from my iPad. Overall, I am very pleased with the price, packaging and performance of the iPhone X. Great Phone !!
<<&&&&>>
The phone works perfectly fine, and honestly ended up exceeding expectations. Looking for a refurbished/renewed phone most times mean that you will have a kink or defect in the phone somewhere but not this one. The phone works great and honestly cant tell what’s supposed to be wrong with the phone. Had for 2 weeks and not a single problem. Would highly recommend buyerspray when ordering yours
<<&&&&>>
El equipo no funciona en Ecuador a pesar de que los comentarios responde que si funciona
<<&&&&>>
1) Works well. Worth the money. Great phone. High % battery life. Kept this phone. 2) Did not work. 80% battery life. Would not connect to Verizon. I sent this phone back for a full refund. The phone looked good and was functional in every way except the most important way... it could not make calls or use data, since it was unable to connect to any cellular network.
<<&&&&>>
The first phone I received was extremely scratched, had trouble making calls, and had poor battery life. The second phone I received worked well for a few weeks and now has serious screen issues. The screen is nonresponsive and does not light up when I touch it. While using the phone, it will randomly open and close various apps, act as though various points have been clicked, add words I never typed, etc. Major problems. I am very unhappy with this product.
<<&&&&>>
Awful!!, I was using the iPhone for less than 2 months and suddenly BLACKOUT during charging !!, no crash no nothing Inadmisible!!!!
<<&&&&>>
The phone came in good condition. I took it to the apple store for a complete inspection to which it passed. Apple would not insure through apple care, but I have assurian coverage through att. Some people mention scratches – mine had a small scratch, but I realize that the screen has a. glass cover which has a small scratch. This was really a great value!
<<&&&&>>
All the bells & whistles for half the price of a “new” one. Came with a screen protector on it & 98% battery health. Couldn’t have done better anywhere. Completely unlocked & ready to rock. FaceID works flawlessly & so did everything else- as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
I bought these as a C’mas gift. Will rate after they open them for C’mas.

I have the iPhone se but wanted to update so I reviewed all the iPhones and found the ten to be the best for the price. After using it for a few months, I made the right choice. I love it and it pairs perfectly with my Apple Watch.
<<&&&&>>
Was unsure how a restored item would be. I've had it a month. Better than new. In perfect working and physical order. Battery lasts a looong time. Very happy. Sure beats $1000 for a brand new one!
<<&&&&>>
Renewed I Phone....had some very light small scratches but when put inside a protective case with a screen protector not noticeable at all. Works perfectly. Arrived with 94% battery capacity remaining.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is like brand new! I absolutely love it!!!
<<&&&&>>
We were a little skeptical about ordered a renewed phone, but this one was exquisite. Our granddaughter just loves it in every way.
<<&&&&>>
This is a great product.
<<&&&&>>
Phone was advertised as fully unlocked and i received a device that was GSM only, waited 5 days with no phone just to receive a device that wasn’t compatible with my network. Super disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
The battery life and performance were exceptional and exceeded expectations. Has been great on T-Mobile network
<<&&&&>>
Working good with all its features Bought it to be used in South America and no problems so far
<<&&&&>>
There was scratches and bad battery life
<<&&&&>>
Looks super new & works great. Saved $500 comparing if purchased new. I ordered a case & screen protector as well; everything arrived the same day. Happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Not good
<<&&&&>>
Works as it should. Love face time
<<&&&&>>
EVERYTHING WORKS AND LOOKS GREAT
<<&&&&>>
This item was returned.
<<&&&&>>
I would highly recommend this phone, this phone is amazing and awesome nothing bad to say about the sellers
<<&&&&>>
Does what it is supposed to
<<&&&&>>
I couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. It looked brand new and came with a pre installed glass screen protector. Battery was at 90% overall I’m super happy and satisfied with this purchase
<<&&&&>>
I like the product didn’t like the person who sold it to me
<<&&&&>>
Very Good
<<&&&&>>
Love the phone and a lot of space for apps
<<&&&&>>
Good value, good product and quick service. As advertised.
<<&&&&>>
The speaker is not working. And has scratches on the screen. Bad customer service
<<&&&&>>
el teléfono era tal cual lo compre! lo único malo es que el cargador y el cable son genéricos, el resto excelente!!!
<<&&&&>>
Back camera fuzzy
<<&&&&>>
Good condition, came with charger.
<<&&&&>>
Price is high as It didn’t have original charger. Also it doesn’t have ear phones at all.
<<&&&&>>
A++++

I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.

The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the "10," as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a "B" for its design: 1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case. 2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily. 3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered. Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term. The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or "expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone." It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the "attention detection," meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the "notch." This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it. Even its flaws.
<<&&&&>>
tried this but went back to android
<<&&&&>>
I will want to buy this i phone but I am afraid, you recommend me to buy it what guarantee do I have if it comes out faulty after 3 months of use? I wonder why I do not live in USA I live in Ecuador
<<&&&&>>
I would like to try the product for free
<<&&&&>>
A bit pricey but worth it. Facial recognition works as password
<<&&&&>>
About this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. Quick delivery and no problems with the product. Would order from here again.
<<&&&&>>
Product like new. No scratches anywhere and performance is great. I would highly recommend buying from this seller. Thank you
<<&&&&>>
Works perfect! Everything looks brand new quality. My daughter is loving it. Very happy with our purchase
<<&&&&>>
Very good product and will buy again
<<&&&&>>
Best quality
<<&&&&>>
As advertised. Great product received. Thanks!
<<&&&&>>
It works great
<<&&&&>>
I ordered a red i8 to replace a i5. I was not expecting to be surprised by reading the reviews. It showed up in 3 days when I opened the box it looked like a new i8 I ordered the red one it was in perfect condition no scratches no dings, dents or scuffs It looks brand new. Set it up in no time every thing is working flawlessly I’ve had it a few weeks and no issues yet. Will repost if anything goes wrong
<<&&&&>>
This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll😍. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its 💯 percent honest. Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.
<<&&&&>>
Physically the phone functions and looks great. The only drawback is that the phone is likely from Japan or another country that has laws requiring camera shutter sounds to always be on so I can’t take selfies because everyone around me will hear it, and the sound isn’t quiet.
<<&&&&>>
Everything that I was expecting. Pretty brand new condition. Battery is good. Functions flawlessly. No complaints. A bit relieved after reading some of the other comments. I’m happy with mine.
<<&&&&>>
anytime you took a picture on silent it still made a noise and they didn’t tell me that very disappointed
<<&&&&>>
Phone works great. Charging cord came unworking out of the box.
<<&&&&>>
Have trouble with the speaker
<<&&&&>>
Like new don’t be afraid to buy
<<&&&&>>
Bueno
<<&&&&>>
This product was amazing, except for one thing. There is only one port and it is for the charger, and the headphones plug in is square. So if you have headphones with the pointy or pug in it won’t work. You have to buy a ten dollar headphone jack. And if you are looking to charge and plug in headphones at the same time you must pay 30 dollars for that jack.
<<&&&&>>
Very quick shipping. The iPhone looks brand new, is showing 99% battery capacity, and is working as expected.
<<&&&&>>
I bought it because the product number is A1905 and A1863 came. Please be careful when you make a purchase because the products you sell and the actual ones that come are carrying.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect timing on delivery. Set up was so easy and this phone has been working so well. Will come back with a 3 month update. But so far I am a very satisfied customer! Highly recommend
<<&&&&>>
It has decent battery life, and I know it has a fingerprint reader built-in, I didn't want to use it. At this point, this cellphone pretty good, though I'm a little concerned about it getting warm while charging.
<<&&&&>>
Easy set up, and decently priced. My son was very excited to open this gift today! I changed my rating for the following reason: A couple of days later, the bottom half of the phone is not working. Sent an e mail explaining what's going on with it, and just waiting on a response now. Once issue is resolved/phone is replaced, I'll be happy again, and will give 5 stars once more.

I wanted a used phone for my teenager and the product arrived with no issues.

Great phone for my first iphone. Super easy to make my way around the OS. Icertified delivered a perfect phone mint condition
<<&&&&>>
Looked very new
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono no tiene buena respuesta táctil. Incluso cerrar ventanas es complicado. Definitivamente no funciona bien. Una mala compra. Si hubiese conocido que iba a tener esos problemas no lo hubiese comprado. Estoy en Ecuador así que ni siquiera puedo devolverlo.
<<&&&&>>
the mic on my doesent work.
<<&&&&>>
I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase! Looks and works like a new one, no brakes or scratches. No need to buy a totally new phone if you can get this.
<<&&&&>>
Muy bien la compra todo como indicaba las descripciones
<<&&&&>>
I like all about it!!

Horrible Do Not Buy won’t even turn on. Wasted money and time with there was - stars for this experience. Had to give 1 star to post but needs to have a 00 star
<<&&&&>>
There are several things wrong with the phone. Cannot hear the person talking unless you have it on the speakerphone. When playing my iTunes music. Volume does not work. Want to return phone.
<<&&&&>>
This is my first smartphone and I have been extremely pleased with how well it functions, how easy it has been to learn to use it (well, after a friend helped me set it up). Great phone at great price.
<<&&&&>>
Nice phone with all the features you would want.

I’ve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I’ve played with the X, and was disappointed. Pros: Battery life is superior to anything I’ve owned Reception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone. The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It’s flawless in your hands. It’s faster than any galaxy or iPhone I’ve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9) The apps are just designed better. I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I’ve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It’s constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it’s BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it’s very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. Stunning Cons: Pricey No headphone jack All glass (doesn’t bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on. No headphones included No cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it’s a non issue) The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality) Overall this truly is an incredible device.
<<&&&&>>
INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I’ve also had Androids and many different types of PC’s. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it’s the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won’t always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.
<<&&&&>>
Face ID does not work
<<&&&&>>
I have had this phone for 33 days and it just stopped working for no reason!!!! I paid $1000 for this phone this is UNACCEPTABLE!!!
<<&&&&>>
Product had scratches on the screen. Definitely heavily used.
<<&&&&>>
I know is use phones but for the price of $700 it looks in a bad condition unfortunately you take a risk when you buy phones with out been able to see them and are used and I am not happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews. I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone. EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all. I'm considering doing a return.
<<&&&&>>
El celular es excelente.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my son that lives in Jamaica as a Christmas gift. You see I was so nervous and skeptical to buy this phone. because of the mixed reviews. the phone came with a charger, the pin to pull out the SIM card draw, a receipt and a instruction card if you’re gonna send it back. The phone and everything mentioned was packed in a nice box. The phone is clean and looks brand new. no scratches or scrapes. it’s also unlocked which is what i payEd for. Everything on the phone seems to be working fine for now, I’ll update later if anything changes. So far I’m happy with my purchase. no complaints
<<&&&&>>
Totalmente descontento con el Iphone. No estaba desbloqueado y no funciona para ninguna compañia. Es una vergüenza porque fue un engaño porque el Iphone lo llevaba para otro país. Sino es porque me doy cuenta a tiempo.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone took awhile to arrive
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for a friend and it never worked. The serial number is invalid. I believe this is complete fake
<<&&&&>>
Fue un fraude la compra
<<&&&&>>
THERE IS NO SIM CARD TRAY!!!😡
<<&&&&>>
Almost new in perfect condition with no issues. No earphones
<<&&&&>>
I've read all the bad reviews and can't help but think there is a serious disconnect between the phones sent to these folks and the ones who have posted the good reviews. My IPhoneX plus with 512gb arrived in absolutely perfect condition. Well, OK, It didn't have all that glamorous packaging that Apple provides but we all know how that adds to the bottom line. I did not need an exciting unboxing experience, I needed a good iPhone X Plus and that is exactly what I received. It's difficult to believe the phone I received was not completely brand new and I can't imagine a phone ordered from Apple to arrive in better condition.
<<&&&&>>
Screen will not turn on. Haven't been able to use the phone at all. One of the screws on the bottom of the phone appears to have a different thread pattern as well.
<<&&&&>>
Buenas tardes. El 27 de agosto se aprobó la devolución de este teléfono, sin embargo hasta la presente fecha ( 11 de octubre ) no se ha hecho el reembolso en mi tarjeta de crédito. Por favor su ayuda. Saludos
<<&&&&>>
First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive. So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.
<<&&&&>>
I was reading reviews of how it was a bad product, which made me not want to purchase from here but then it came in the mail and although it didn’t come with original box and charger the phone is perfect 10/10. so far I love it
<<&&&&>>
I like this phone
<<&&&&>>
I bought the renewed one because I think new iPhone is way overpriced. Just received my order today and it is bit of disappointment. It didn’t come with genuine Apple charger and earphone is not included. Phone shows scratch marks all around bezel. Luckily screen is OK because there is a screen protector. But the protector was put on slanted so it is an eye sore itself. And it is the glass type protector, I will have to figure out how to remove it myself. So far the phone itself functions OK and hopefully it will last a while. Just this buying experience is not what I expected.
<<&&&&>>
Not unlocked. Do not buy
<<&&&&>>
When I purchased this phone from BuySPRY I was a little skeptical it would not arrive in good condition due to other comments saying they received theirs with scratches and cracks. Mine came in great condition with no scratches but just a little ware on the sides but nothing major. The battery life of this phone is amazing and last me all day and then some. I got it for an amazing price and I am very happy with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Came in mint condition. Practically new. Fully unlocked so I could just swap my StraightTalk SIM card over and use my old iPhone to transfer it easily. 256GB storage is amazing. Camera quality it’s out of this world. I love it! Only downside was the shipping time. It took a little bit longer than the typical Prime Free Two-Day shipping. Was still free on prime but took around 5 days. Might be different depending on what seller you buy from. Other than that I’m very happy! I’ve been long over due for a phone upgrade with me still having a iPhone 6S Plus before I got this one lol
<<&&&&>>
I can't find enough good words to say regarding this seller and the iPhone XS Max. It arrived a day ahead of the scheduled delivery, and it is absolutely in brand-new condition. You would not be able to see a difference between this phone and one brand-new from an Apple store. It was packaged with care and also had a genuine Apple charger and cable. I've tested every feature and all are working. The SIM from my iPhone 5c worked immediately when I powered it up and went through the setup, and I made my first call within three minutes of opening the box. I saved at least $450 in buying a renewed phone instead of a new one, yet I essentially have a new phone. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
<<&&&&>>
I have been debating as to how I should write this as a avid Apple user I’m very happy with the product I’m a little upset that when I received my used apple iPhone XS max I ordered the Verizon Version and instead receive the Sim card unlocked version the phone did come with a Screen protector but it was to hide the deep scratches in the screen the Battery life is down to 92% Capability I’m happy but upset at the same time also I have to update this review as I have just discovered the flash and rear camera is not working at all can’t even take a photo or use the flashlight
<<&&&&>>
Nice product
<<&&&&>>
Ordered: Unlocked iPhone Xs Max Silver-(256GB) I’ve seen a few one star reviews, so here’s a full honest review. The phone arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was light, but also secured. After un-wrapping the phone. I’ve noticed it had no front/back glass scratches or cracks. However, it did have hardly noticeable chips on the metal sides. The phone was also a little dirty around the edges and camera. (Which was easy to remove and back clean!) As promised the phone was unlocked with 256GB.
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone in June, I can't be happier. Came in like new condition, battery at a 100% can last over 24hrs of normal use (I upgraded from iphone 6s which battery lasted merely 6-8hrs). I would really recommend this phone.
<<&&&&>>
It works and performs as described. The iPhone is way faster than my old iPhone 6plus. Although it is the exact same dimensions as the old phone. Except for the camera lense on the back. Otherwise an excellent product. Thanks
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new, a little bit of dust in the top front microphone but a fine bristle brush helped get 90% of that dust out. Battery works great, screen unscratched, back unscratched, I love it. Great upgrade. NEVER BUYING A NEW iPHONE AGAIN. Amazon Renewed is the way to go.
<<&&&&>>
El telefono esta Like new!!! Funcionamiento perfecto, quizas la vida util de la bateria no es la del cel nuevo, pero diria que esta al 85%.... Con gran uso de redes sociales me alcanza 12 horas sin recargar
<<&&&&>>
This damn phone is not unlocked”$???????????
<<&&&&>>
I am very much getting what I expected out this product, and I am just happy. It might have have been a little pricey, but hey, life is not always all about money!
<<&&&&>>
Only had the phone for a day and it won’t let anyone call me and won’t let me make outgoing calls
<<&&&&>>
Like all apple phones you know what you’re getting. If you want a phone that does more and goes beyond expectations you might be disappointed especially for the price you pay, but you’re basically paying for the name, “premium” feel, and ease of use. If you’re looking for great phones to get instead check out the Pixels, Galaxies, or the One Plus series of phones for great alternatives; but so far this phone has been great for me, I will try to give updates on any negative or positive changes. So finally there is a phone out for everyone so look around and find what works best for you.
<<&&&&>>
I found the phone having various glitches throughout its use. For one, the camera is lower quality than the same phone that my friends had and had purchased new. It would often get very hot. Lots of apps would crash and it would run slowly. Often the front camera would not be as receptive and it would crash. The camera would often remain black and wouldn't work until I reset the whole phone. Lots of problems in general. Don't recommend...
<<&&&&>>
I really love my new phone, I have more than a week used and I can’t complain I was new unlocked, 256 gb and the battery is 100%
<<&&&&>>
Hey i got to say the phone looks really new shoutout to networkstore for this really good product it just came today because i bought as an gift the person is loving it i would give 5 stars but just because its the first day im gonna play it safe but really good phone so far and it looks super new highly recommend if you dont wanna pay full price no orginal box but comes with charger and it is great....!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
The product arrived on time. The phone looked absolutely brand new. It came with a charger in a box. I have been using it for a week, haven’t found a problem at all. The phone is in perfect shape and does not show any problem. Definitely recommended
<<&&&&>>
Let me start by saying phone is exactly as described. It’s also in very good condition based on the price. However, I almost thought I had been duped, the box the phone came in was one of those Walmart $50 “smart” phones, and the charger and cube were not the original. Which I understand, because of the low low price. I cannot stress this enough, the phone is in almost a perfect condition, there are a few scratches on the screen, but they are very superficial, and the phone runs just like new. Certainly recommend it, and this seller as well.
<<&&&&>>
It’s not working and has problems. This phone has liquid damage and has been sent for Apple to repair, and the problem is not solved because it cost 599 to repair. Now they are selling it to me.
<<&&&&>>
El celular no me sirvió para t-mobile quiero regresarlo
<<&&&&>>
A choice between the iPhone 2019 Pro/Max and the X/XS Max pointed me towards the X. Phone is beyond pristine. If you're in the market for one, I suggest you ante up $20 and get a screen protector. BO.FYI
<<&&&&>>
I received my phone promptly and it is in like new condition. It meets and exceeds my expectations. Thank you:)
<<&&&&>>
This phone is not unlocked,. Scam!
<<&&&&>>
Me encanta el artículo, está perfecto , impecable como nuevo, lo único es que la batería dura poco... pensé que duraría más... pero por lo demás ... maravilloso
<<&&&&>>
i bought the phone fully unlocked but when i went to get a service it says it’s locked to AT&T !!! I am more then pissed ! Because my service is TMobile so i can’t do anything with this phone unless i pay someone to unlock it ! When i payed all this money for this phone to already be unlocked!!
<<&&&&>>
All I gotta say is this phone was definitely worth it! I was skeptical buying a renewed phone since some people have had problems with locked phones, etc. (I think it can depend on who you buy it from) My phone came in perfect condition, not a blemish on it and it was unlocked! Couldn’t have asked for a better phone and I’m so happy! I have a new phone now and saved so much by buying renewed :D
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Phone arrived and screen WAS flickering . There is no way the seller did not know about this issue . Phone was still under warranty and took it to Apple to be repaired . Disappointed that I had to take time to take it to Apple to have it repaired . Not a trustworthy seller at all
<<&&&&>>
it is in a very good condition.
<<&&&&>>
YOU SHOULD DEF BUY THIS !!!!! iphone didn’t come in apple box. but accessories look like apple accessories. phone like brand new. no scratches or anything. very happy w this company.
<<&&&&>>
over 1 month and operated perfectly, glad I went with the max.
<<&&&&>>
Horrible. Phone came locked unable to use with any carrier
<<&&&&>>
Very good product. Screen protector need to be bought additionally
<<&&&&>>
Specs arrived as ordered. Phone works perfectly, battery life is as new. I'm not giving 5 stars because phone has a tiny scratch (barely noticeable) one third of the way from the bottom of the screen. Other than that, everything is as I hoped it would be. I guess I was luckier than most people here.
<<&&&&>>
I was very pleasantly surprised with this phone. When you buy refurbished, you never really know what you will get. However, I was one of the lucky ones and this phone seemed brand new! No marks, no defects, top notch performance, it’s almost like somebody bought it new and immediately sent it back without using it. An excellent buy for sure!
<<&&&&>>
It's actually giving a bit of problems
<<&&&&>>
I had to return the 256gb gold unlocked phone. It was definitely not unlocked and had few scratches on the back. Not to noticeable but just couldn’t get it connected with my service.
<<&&&&>>
Basically indistinguishable from a new phone. Had a minor hiccup with voicemail activation on Verizon that was resolved by calling them. Doesn't come with headphones or a dongle; comes with a non-OEM charger and cable.
<<&&&&>>
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
<<&&&&>>
Ok
<<&&&&>>
Cheap charging wire
<<&&&&>>
I was very apprehensive buying a used phone online with all the “horror” stories I’ve heard. Seemed like a reputable seller and the item arrived as described without issue.
<<&&&&>>
Showed up with off brand charger and adapter and a shattered camera. Would not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
Bought as Xmas gift for my wife, she likes it
<<&&&&>>
Ordered this phone upgrading from a iphone 5s. I was worried to order from amazon to spend $850 on a phone like this. I got the phone quickly within 3 days, and not a scratch on it, battery life is great. no issues whatsoever. Very happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
El tel esta como nuevo intacto apesar de no ser certificado por Apple estoy feliz
<<&&&&>>
Was a value of money, was same as i saw in youtube not malfunctions or any bad features and happy to deal with them.
<<&&&&>>
Nunca me llegó el celular!!! No me dan solución
<<&&&&>>
I’ve been using this for about a week and I’m convinced that it’s a new phone. The only thing that worries me is in a week my maximum battery capacity dropped 8%. But overall the phone is great.
<<&&&&>>
Face ID does not work. A feature I purchased this phone specifically for.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition, easy to sync to my network and cloud 10/10

I was scare after reading horribles reviews but it work perfectly and literally no scratches

Paid for a 256gb Gold XSmax, but received a 64gb Gray Xs max. Sigh
<<&&&&>>
A brand new phone costs 100 bucks cheaper as of 4/30/2019
<<&&&&>>
The same amount is at the apple store brand new and its sealed and its also unlocked right from the Manufactuer Apple. if it was like 5-700 I would say ok its cheaper. My rating is not on the phone, its on the fact that your paying too much for a referbished (renewed phone). I may as well go to Apple and pay full price!!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
why waste so much money on a renewed phone when the NEW one on apple is for $150 less. What a rip off
<<&&&&>>
I would recommend to buy it from the apple store since the prices are pretty similar and a lot of different reasons
<<&&&&>>
This product is the second iPhone i have owned since the screen came out OLED and without a home button. I received this device and my initial impressions was that it was a bit large and heavier then iPhone's i have had in the past . I upgraded from an iPhone X and over time i have become pretty attached to the clarity of the screen and display overall. The performance of this phone accompanied by the clear camera and 4K video quality, certainly brings much to the table . The things i disliked about this phone are the lightning connector is still present several years later as well as the phone gets hot during using the maps application when i am traveling in my car . This phone can drain a battery heavily .
<<&&&&>>
You don’t realize how heavy a phone can be until you are on it 6 hours a day. This phone starts to deteriorate pretty quickly; it’s only been around 5 months and the screen does not work as well; and there are so many actions this phone can do; I spent like guessing 5 to 10 percent of my time on it; correcting errors. 20 percent of the time I touch an icon; it doesn’t activate; but instead swipes left or right. I should be an expert on touching icons by now; yet still it happens. The apps this phone can use are really great and fun; but they need to seriously work on a hands free device and triple their man hours on the glitches and errors. Let the Chinese use the newest IOS for a year before releasing to the rest of the world; so they can deal with all the problems. One more thing; stop making the outside of the phone so slick; The slightest degree this phone is from horizontal, and there it falls off. You have to take the case off because it gets too hot, too quick. My screen dims like every five minutes. I could go on and on; but Apple knows; it’s just about the money for them.
<<&&&&>>
I like it best purchase I’ve made!!! 😁
<<&&&&>>
Me gusta la Iphone. La telefone es muy rápido. Cuando recogo la telefone mi siento felize. La cámara en la telefone is fabuloso. La calculadora en la telefone es la razon me hacer bueno en mi universidad. Mi ciudad es muy grande y la mapa en la telephone es muy bueno tener. La telfone es ahora algo que necesito.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is quite amazing and powerful, however the price is wild and to be completely honest with you, doesn't make up for what you bought it for.
<<&&&&>>
I bought one of these phones Currently using it rite now and the Face ID does not work I shipped it to my mother in the US then and she brought it to Jamaica to me so it was hard for me to send it back.....all I’m saying is test ur products properly b4 selling them
<<&&&&>>
Está muy bien pero el cargador q me mandaron no sirve no es el original y no trae audífonos 😕☹️
<<&&&&>>
I'm glad I checked out the reviews before buying I'm not about to waste any $800 to $1,000
<<&&&&>>
Amazon como siempre muy serio y responsable el teléfono llegó sin un solo detalle muy buena su presentación y protección impecable .
<<&&&&>>
Appearance good ; operation good; battery life 96% ; Lenovo charger ; Energizer cable ; unknown gift box. For me, satisfaction!
<<&&&&>>
There bad dog
<<&&&&>>
The phone is not unlocked. I can’t use it with my t-mobile. It only works with Verizon sim. Seller hasn’t refunded. They are ripping people off. I am highly disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
First phone was not unlocked. I got blocked my network after putting the SIM card in it and it's been a nightmare to get my old phone working again with he SIM card. Apparently the phone is still hooked up to its old phone network and now I can't use it or my old phone. Requested a replacement hoping that the replacement won't have the same issue......
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono me llego en excelentes condiciones, caja, cargador y cable originales, pantalla perfecta, rendimiento de batería genial, totalmente desbloqueado para cualquier operadora, no incluyen los audífonos, pero eso no fue un problema para mi..
<<&&&&>>
I know it would have been great, but I ordered it by mistake. Had to send it back.
<<&&&&>>
Purchased a “renewed” XS Max a few weeks ago with some trepidation. However, it looks and operates like brand new. Didn’t get the insurance since it didn’t look like a good deal. I’m VERY happy with my decision and enjoy the phone more since I didn’t have to pay the full price.
<<&&&&>>
I hesitated to buy at first as it was renewed. Also the comments inflicted on me. But after I got the iphone, it was orijinal and no signs of use was on it. Do not believe in the baf comments. It is orijinal and I recommend to be bought. That is it.
<<&&&&>>
The phone worked like brand new when I received and is still working strong
<<&&&&>>
Love it! I really was skeptical and expecting the worst, but it was in pristine condition! Works perfectly; However, I did buy the 2 year protection...just in case ;)
<<&&&&>>
BATTERY WAS SMOKING AND BURNED ME SO I THREW IT AWAY DO NOT BUY
<<&&&&>>
Phone is fine, aside from I ordered silver and I got a white or pearly white color. Which is not what I wanted.
<<&&&&>>
I expected the refurbished iPhone XS Max to come with all items it was originally sold with. The audio phones were not included. This is especially annoying because only audio phones with a special plugin will work on this iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect 100% condition from NETWORKSTORE. And battery was at 100%
<<&&&&>>
Solid packaging, item appears new, comes with charger, functions well, item as described.
<<&&&&>>
Good quality and good price, easy to use!
<<&&&&>>
Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here’s why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn’t find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that’s different from Samsung, it’s better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn’t burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it’s battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don’t lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don’t mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That’s over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I’m still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy’s S Voice. I don’t have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that’s significantly faster especially when you’re in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that’s not a fair comparison but it’s reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can’t compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It’s not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don’t take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don’t have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don’t own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you’re spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you’re in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can’t believe I waited this long to switch. There was a time when I loved the Galaxy but that was when I first bought it.
<<&&&&>>
Well i pad 1400$ for it so that’s crazy but phone is amazing and takes the best pictures of any phone in my family and i have not had a single issue in last 8 months
<<&&&&>>
I was very hesitant about buying an iPhone off of Amazon, but I did it and was not disappointed. It came with 100% battery life, so it basically was brand new. It came with a charger and cube (plug), but that's it. Sorry to disappoint those who into that airpod life. No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down. But what it lacks in that feature, the iPhone delivers in the portrait camera mode, I seriously am in love with the blur feature. Sincerely, A very satisfied Amazon customer
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in perfect condition and works great but came without EarPods and the the lightning to earphone jack adapter that is pictured with “what’s in the box”. If you must replace these, the $20 open box discount is not worth it. If I did not already have Bluetooth headphones, and received Amazon Visa discount points, I would have returned.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is froze up and unable to use. Very poor product *Edit* within five minutes of talking with Amazon tech support the started working just fine
<<&&&&>>
One - It comes in a weird box Two it had more scuffs and scratches than I’d like for the price 3 - I had to return it because of how over all lame it came and how it showed up/ battery was pretty warn/scratches/ and I didn’t get the awesome feeling of unboxing it..
<<&&&&>>
WISH I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO! NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE
<<&&&&>>
Thanks , i feeling very nice satisfacción with a new cellphone. Look like brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Suddenly Wifi is not working properly and i could see phone feels hot with calls dropping abruptly . I am really not sure of what to do .
<<&&&&>>
First off I’m going to say that I recieved and iPhone xs MAX, not the standard xs like it’s advertised. Not a big deal to me, but it might be to some people. Also as the other review states, it comes with a charger but not the headphones or the headphone adapter. Other than that it looks brand new and came very quickly! Overall very satisfied. Honestly though, since this is the same price as a new xs, I would probably recommend just buying a brand new one instead.
<<&&&&>>
Item arrived with cracked screen, no refund issue still.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was broken, the front microphone was not working when we got it. It took a couple days to figure it out but after we did I contacted the seller for help. They responded very quickly and told me I could either return it to them for another "renewed" one or take it to the Apple store since it was still under warranty. We took it to the Apple store. They looked at it and did some diagnostics right in the store and the phone self reported that the microphone was broken. Dealing with Apple was horrible - in short it took 2 months, 3 trips (7 hours total) at the the Apple store before we had a phone that worked. The renewed cellular people were nice and quick to respond but the fact that the phone self reported a broken microphone and they still sold it is upsetting. This phone should not have been sold and they could easily tell it was not fixed (the "scan" took 2 minutes in the store). I can't hold the horrible experience at Apple against this seller but from Apple I got a new phone and I didn't want to take the chance on another renewed one from the seller - as it was obvious their check is not thorough. In short next time I am going to just get the new phone.
<<&&&&>>
phone was not in as good of shape as i expected at this price point. the battery life has consistently gotten worse until the point it can no longer hold charge. i’ve contacted about a return and they have yet to offer any support
<<&&&&>>
Firstly, this iphone is really like new. Battery life %100. But i don’t believe the charging cable is original. Cuz as seen in the photos, The material is really poor quality, the cable shape is distorted with a slight bending. As is known, it is a factor that affects charging and phone performance.
<<&&&&>>
I really would leave 0 stars if it were possible. Be careful with "renewed" phones on Amazon. I left it charging almost 2 whole days and it never turned on. And yes I tried different chargers. Went to different outlets and the phone would never turn on. It also did not look new as mentioned. I will never ever buy a "renewed" product off of anyone on Amazon. It is just really frustrating because what if I needed a phone by a certain day and I am relying on Amazon do deliver a perfectly working phone. And now I am unfortunately just involved in a hassle.
<<&&&&>>
It's compatible with my carrier (metro by t-mobile) all I had to do was ask. It doesn't appear to have any preexisting problems. I switched over from android and to my surprise it didn't take long to get fully acclimated to iOS (maybe a day or two). I forget what shipping option I chose (I think 1 day or something) but it arrived pretty quickly (within US i believe), definitely worth the extra bucks.
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy this phone. It has so many problems like it won’t charge and the battery life is terrible. Just buy it from apple itself because it will be new.
<<&&&&>>
This is a great iPhone. I got it for my grandpa who upgraded from an iPhone 6. The 11 was already announced when we got this, but he didn't like the 11 (not pro) because it was bigger and more expensive and the screen on this is a lot better. The phone as a whole is alright. The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone. This can be a good deal over the iPhone 11 pro, especially if you aren't going to be using a wide angle lens.
<<&&&&>>
The phone had a larger than expected scratch on the screen. Scratch was about 1 inch and half. Maybe i had a bad unit. It was clean everywhere else and they put the screen protector on top of the screen But for the price and like new condition it stated on the description it was disappointing.
<<&&&&>>
I was skeptical about ordering this phone after reading all the comments.. I gave it a shot and ordered a gold xs 256gb . After receiving the product and started using it I realized that the battery was decreasing rapidly so I rushed and checked the battery life which showed 96% I then received an update from apple which kinda fixed the battery life problem I had to buy a battery case in order to use it for a full day .. my other fault was that I couldn’t increase the volume over 50% or else the speakers would start to distort which is horrible.. I contacted Amazon for a partial refund since I could not return the phone because I’m currently on a business trip but all I got was it wasn’t possible... please be careful when u purchase this item
<<&&&&>>
No por que mitieron esta bloqueado si neli pueden desbloquear para no recordarlo el celular es delo peor está persona no me quiso pagar mi dinero 123 mala persona no le coplen nada
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived in great condition with 97% battery capacity. Works very well. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 I purchased back in 2015. This phone is a spectacular upgrade and works in every way I want it to. Totally worth buying renewed over new. I love just staring at how beautiful it is before I put a case on it.
<<&&&&>>
Was nervous ordering refurbished but I cannot see any evidence it was ever touched. Battery shows 100% capacity, no scratches or marks anywhere and fully unlocked, tried sprint, att, and cricket Sim and all register and operate without issue.
<<&&&&>>
i orderd a phone for my son and when it came it was not the phone i even ordred it was a different cell phone so i had to return it
<<&&&&>>
I was very nervous about buying a renewed product this expensive, but I've had the phone for a month or two and love it. Works great, no problems and in great condition. As far as value for the money, Apple will never rate high in that category for me. lol
<<&&&&>>
WOW! I’m a very skeptical shopper. I thought the description and the price for my phone was too good to be true. My phone was an exact match of the description and I could not be happier. Absolutely spotless, free of marks or scratches. The battery life is currently the same what would be on a new phone. Impressed with the seller’s ability to match a description with the product. I was very skeptical since pictures were not even posted of the phone. I just shopped for months and went with the best seller reviews. Which is why I am choosing to leave you with my experience. No doubt I will buy from this seller again.
<<&&&&>>
The iphone is in good condition externally. But internally there was a serious issue with the battery and Face id would never work. Make sure to check the phone battery and Face id feature working.
<<&&&&>>
With this price you don’t need to get a refurbished phone when a new one is $40 more
<<&&&&>>
So happy with my iPhone XS Battery is at a 90% screen is flawless. Back glass is flawless. Face ID works. So far I’m happy. You get 90 Day with amazon and also from the seller. happy Happy Happy.
<<&&&&>>
El artículo llego en buenas condiciones estéticas pero no funciona el face id y la pantalla tiene flashes y cambia de color. No funciona correctamente
<<&&&&>>
Easy to set up, perfect condition! Fair price.
<<&&&&>>
two different phone both said fully unlocked per amazon/seller and both were tied to a different carrier..
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or damage of any kind, actually it's like new. I tested the battery life and it is in excelent condition too. The phone is unlocked as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with dents, cracks and scratches along the edges of the screen, overall moderate condition but not worth the price paid honestly, maybe $600 max but that’s my opinion. I’d rather not wait more time to return it and get a new one since it will just waste time to get an item with the exact same condition back. Phone came with a cheap knockoff lightning charger, only charges on one side and overheats often. Shipping was fast and reliable. Item is great honestly but I would recommend buying the max same storage and everything because it’s the same price with other sellers.
<<&&&&>>
I returned it on next day as the speaker of phone was not working. Disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
I had to get in and write an initial review so that anyone considering this phone for a gift would feel confident with their purchase. Anytime you see “renewed” you expect something less than new but your not sure how it will compare to new. Honestly in this case you would not know the difference. I was pleasantly surprised. I received this phone yesterday and it is perfect as if I just unboxed a new iPhone XS. The phone powered on and had 100% battery. I am so please with this phone. It also arrived 4 days ahead of the expected delivery date. Thank you CellCow.
<<&&&&>>
Lucia y está como. Nuevo
<<&&&&>>
Love it ! It’s brand brand new phone and I can’t ask for more ! Thank you
<<&&&&>>
When I say this phone came like new, I mean it actually had 0 scratches on it with 100% battery, so that was a nice surprise. I also confirmed with Apple to make sure the phone was real, It’s possible I I just got an excellent previous owner, but from my experience this was well worth it. A+++
<<&&&&>>
Came with 100% battery health (battery was new), packaged well, and came early. After around 5 hours of use everything seems to be working well. Also came with a 90 day warranty.
<<&&&&>>
Came in great condition and very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
Love love love. Perfect condition in its appearance and no issues when using. Wrong color but that doesn’t matter to me. Very happy.
<<&&&&>>
It is good refurbisded phone. I like it.
<<&&&&>>
The device doesn’t even come in an apple box nor comes with apple certified charging cable or wall socket. The packaging was very poor. I did not expect Amazon Renewed standards to be so low.
<<&&&&>>
Im really impress wasn't to sure to get an iPhone from Amazon , wasn't to sure what i was going to receive . But I am really happy with the phone looks beautiful and works great no problem. This seller is really good won't mind buying form them again. Thank you
<<&&&&>>
This phone is absolutely awesome for the price. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but the phone came in perfect condition. It comes with a charger and box, but like the other reviews said, it doesn’t come with an adapter or the AirPods which was not an issue with me because it was such a good price. Definitely worth the buy, had no issues setting up
<<&&&&>>
I was a little skeptical at first about amazon renewed products due to the reviews that i was reading however everything came in good condition phone came with no box but the charger and the wall block , I had even seen people saying there phone arrived with less than 100% battery life. Mine however came with 100%. I recommended this phone to anyone looking for a XS in good condition for a good price.
<<&&&&>>
Accurate and quality product just love my new phone and love the delivery service super fast
<<&&&&>>
It's not original and I paid more than original I don't know what to say els
<<&&&&>>
Battery condition was at 89%, very minor scratches, and seems to be working like normal. Very pleased with this purchase!
<<&&&&>>
I ordered I Phone XS 256 GB and it shipped very fast and delivered in 3 days. I was worried about the quality of the renewed phone but when I opened it, it was like in new condition. no scratch and no dent. So far it is working great. 88 perfect battery health. The phone charger is not generic (not from apple) but working fine.
<<&&&&>>
Phone didn’t come with the headphones.. with the price you would think it would come in original packaging and all accessories. And if not the original accessories, you would think they would at least send other ones you can use. Phone works fine, ONLY COMES WITH THE CHARGING CABLE, not even the wall plug. So obnoxious. Won’t purchase from them again.
<<&&&&>>
I love my new phone!!! I use to buy my phone on eBay and I always end up with problems, but this phone is actually working pretty well for me
<<&&&&>>
Looked and felt like new. Everything works except the “selfie” camera. Makes a weird vertical red line on top of image. Not a deal breaker for me since Face-ID still works.
<<&&&&>>
Battary life was around 90%, Some skratches on the screen, though for value of money its quite fair : )
<<&&&&>>
Great value and condition. Arrived like new, no scratches, battery life at 98% I’m so happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived a day early. No scratches that I could find, phone looks brand new. 100% battery life. Seems to be completely functioning so far! I was hesitant to get a refurbished phone, but I’m glad I did! Worth the savings! It was just the phone and a charger, no other accessories.
<<&&&&>>
Great condition
<<&&&&>>
Apple iPhone XS is a great phone and the seller kept his side of the deal. However, when I received the phone, I was not impressed due to the small screen size. I have shipped it back through UPS; and ordered Apple iPhone XS Max, 6.5", 512GB instead.
<<&&&&>>
Para nada, esta todo flojo y no trae audífonos y el cargador es chino no es el Original no lo quiero
<<&&&&>>
It came within the promised time period and the item is close to being brand new. good value for money.
<<&&&&>>
Very clean refurbished phonr
<<&&&&>>
Purple line appeared on my screen and it won’t go away didn’t happen until after my return window closed
<<&&&&>>
No problem what's so ever
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in very used condition with huge scratches on the screen
<<&&&&>>
The phone keeps on freezing. It’s so slow! Not really the price I paid.
<<&&&&>>
Absolutely love it. It came unlocked. And it world’s wonderfully. I would take a picture but I’m using it to write this review.inwas skeptical but I’m glad I took the chance . Thanks !

<<&&&&>>
As a renewed product I was a bit unsure buying this product. However everything seems okay with a full battery life. Unfortunately doesn’t come with headphones.
<<&&&&>>

<<&&&&>>
Like brand new!!!
<<&&&&>>
Works great
<<&&&&>>
The seller was iPower Resale Inc, and the iPhone was in a good condition. Minor scratches on the screen, and battery was 91% of peak performance.
<<&&&&>>
Very good came with case and screen protector which made me appreciate the work from seller or else my phone would have been cracked severely
<<&&&&>>
Solid phone. Easy set up. No issues with it being unlocked. No marks. No flaws. Battery lasts all day with lots of active use.
<<&&&&>>
Good condition but the screen is a bit scratched all in all it’s in good condition.
<<&&&&>>
Just what it described
<<&&&&>>
Everything works well... except the speakers. It sounds too low (sounds like it once entered water)...
<<&&&&>>
Como nuevo

<<&&&&>>
Phone looks brand new and worked perfectly with xfinity mobile. Definitely would buy again in the future.

I just purchased phone yesterday. The phone looks good but I can barely hear my calls. It’s only loud on speaker.

To summarize it all, I would buy again & encourage anyone to buy too.

<<&&&&>>
Wish i could give them 6!!!! POSITIVE Experience
<<&&&&>>
I had iPhone XS and it was my first iPhone. For the first two months it worked fine. The problems started with iOS updates. The first update didn't install and some apps stopped working. After the support people fixed it, the phone started to shut down on its own. The next update turned the phone into a brick. When I tried to turn it on, it would display that "Connect to iTunes" picture. At the Apple store the technician magically revived the phone using a new update but the very next day the phone started to drop wifi connection. I think the phone had serious hardware problems but Apple engineers figured out how to partially overcome the problems through software tricks. This is how Apple avoids replacing a bad phone with a new one. I ended up paying for an upgrade.
<<&&&&>>
Ok I got a space gray iPhone XS with 256GB and I was happy to get it, it came in a odd box but I didn’t really care about that I got the phone and there are dings and scratch’s on The outer metal case of the phone and I can tell that I he front glass and LCD scream were replaced be the screen kinda drags the image like on a old computer we’re the image stays for a second, that was one thing I was annoyed about that but the second thing was that it sound like the bottom speaker was broken at one point and they bought another one but it is a really cheap speaker because at certain points it has a pitch of sound with it and it just doesn’t sound good the speaker next to the Face ID camera works perfectly just the one at the bottom of the phone is really bad me personally I don’t care if it has dings or scratch’s on the outer Metal frame of the phone it just really annoys me when they replace the speaker with a bad one and that they get a cheaper LCD screen just to save a little bit of money I mostly notice the bad cream when I’m scrolling on instagram, Twitter or YouTube it’s when you are scrolling that it is the most noticeable problem wouldn’t buy again if I new they replaced parts with bad ones also battery gets kinda worm/hot when charging or on FaceTime and sometimes just randomly but that may just happen when running powerful or changing so that may just be normal not to sure but the battery stays charged all day so not too worried about the battery
<<&&&&>>
I loved it
<<&&&&>>
I looked at plenty reviews on this phone and found out it is nothing as described. This is not cool especially with such a high price.
<<&&&&>>
Best forever
<<&&&&>>
Honestly, I am tremendously satisfied with my purchase! There’s not a single difference between this and a brand new iphone..10/10 would buy again
<<&&&&>>
I would like to promote this product. I’m an instagram reviewer.
<<&&&&>>
These people tamper with the phones in order to unlock them, in my case it arrived unable to be updated to any version of iOS, rendering it useless, as you have to update to restore from backup. It's also unable to be restored to complete factory reset (through the recovery screen reset method using itunes). I got on the phone with them and they told me to "Wait a couple of days" because there's a problem at apple's end. Joke is on them, I talked to apple to try and get this thing updated but no matter what we tried it was impossible. The phone is a dud and they want me to wait a few days? Get real!
<<&&&&>>
Phone works fine, but the claim “looks like new” is a joke. I tried twice ordering from the same seller and the condition was worse the 2nd time. Covered in scratches and battery life depleted to 86%. Sad, irritating experience and sellers route of recourse was to call a phone number that responded “mailbox full”. Save yourself the frustration and order a phone directly from Apple.
<<&&&&>>
Compared to my 6, it’s different. Took some time getting used to no home screen. Occasionally the data/ wifi connection gets iffy. I still have the same plan as i did w my 6 and still the same circumstances (same home wifi, same job/ school ect) calls/ facetime will occasionally freeze/ sound fuzzy if i am not connected to wifi. That was never a problem with my 6 (my 6 was a GSM unlocked, idk if that has anything to do with it) I wear glass, and sometimes the face ID does not recognize me if i do not have them on. Battery life is great! And i like being able to access low power mode easier than having to go through settings all the time! All in all, good phone. I can tell you one thing, it is not worth $600+. The raw materials used to make iphones are worth less than $10. This was the best price i found for this phone, so thank you!!!
<<&&&&>>
I was Leary buying a renewed phone but was more than pleasantly surprised. The phone arrived totally unblemished and was just what I was looking for and was the right price. Setting up the phone which was a Verizon locked phone took only 15-20 minutes. Everything from my iPhone 7 was transferred first. I then installed the SIM card removed from the 7 and basically it was up and running. All of my worst fears never came true at all. The phone was totally wonderful and was exactly what was ordered. Looks feels and acts like a brand new iPhone XS.
<<&&&&>>
I know the price point is tempting but don’t do it! I just received the iPhone I ordered and it was terrible condition. I’m not sure how it passed their “quality inspection” but it came with scratches all over and with a broken screen... It gets better because now I have to pay for the return shipping. Just save yourself a headache and don’t do it.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little bit scared of my purchase given the one star review, but I was extremely pleasant Lee surprised. The phone I received looks completely brand new (I looked for any defects and I couldn’t find one), the battery health is 100, and the screen is great. I would highly recommend buying this if you’re interested.
<<&&&&>>
Phone screen was in pretty rough shape when we got it. Expected much more but spent $200 on a new screen and then found out that the phone was warped. Not in the condition that it was promised, very disappointed. Will not buy from here again.
<<&&&&>>
Problems with iOS, battery has half life, intermittently turns off on its own, marred back glass, scratched screen, screen adhesive seeping out of edges. Not as advertised, not carrier free (or unlocked), running a flash program overtop the iOS to simulate being unlocked which takes up both memory being used and ability to run programs.
<<&&&&>>
I got a new phone for half the price!!! 100% battery health, when received. I scrupulously went over it & THE ONLY blemish I could even notice was a barely-visual blemish on the camera bezel.
<<&&&&>>
Works great! Very happy with purchase. I’ve had it for several months now just to make sure the battery is still charging before leaving a review. Couldn’t be happier.
<<&&&&>>
It is almost new phone. No scratches whatsoever. I checked with Apple and the phone was just 4 months old. Really happy with my purchase. Thank you. It comes in generic white box and with just charger. No headphones included.
<<&&&&>>
Good Mobile, I like iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Good phone
<<&&&&>>
Like new condition! Love it!
<<&&&&>>
The reviews here almost made me decide not to buy this phone. I'm so glad that I didn't listen. My phone arrived on time in absolutely perfect condition. I checked all over and there's not a single scratch or dent on this thing. It also has a brand new battery. I verified that my phone was genuine by the serial number on the Apple website and confirmed it was real. The reviews here say that it doesn't come with a stock Apple charger, but mine did as well as the cord. I didn't get headphones, but that doesn't bother me. Definitely give this a try and purchase from one of the Amazon fulfilled sellers. I purchased my phone from Gryphon Commerce.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little sceptical buying this phone because some of the reviews said that the phone they received was locked or had slight damage. However, the one I received was perfect. It came fully unlocked and undamaged. It looks as if I had baught it straight from apple. So far an overall 5 stars and no complaints.
<<&&&&>>
I purchased this phone for my daughter and it came with no scratches or marks, however it did not come with headphones
<<&&&&>>
Received my IPhone a few days ago and everything is working. There’s a barely noticeable scratch on the screen, but that is normal since it is refurbished. I was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews, but my phone is unlocked (checked with Apple) and I love it. My seller was 2019bestsale, it’s a little bit more expensive but worth it.
<<&&&&>>
I don’t know why everyone’s giving this seller a bad review. Excellent phone and fast shipping 5 stars for me . I will be back to buy more soon.
<<&&&&>>
No headphone ,the charger is not original
<<&&&&>>
i absolutly LOVED this IPhone XR it was wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
It took a little while for it to arrive. But other than that it is a great phone, nice pictures, its pretty heavy though. But iPhones are not for me, I'm going back to Samsung
<<&&&&>>
This seller is amazing was a bit skeptical at first but this phone met my every expectation, very trustworthy in every way no it doesn’t come with headphones. At least it comes with a charger & a 90 day warranty I also got a brand new spanking battery I’ve checked the serial number online it is worthy!!
<<&&&&>>
Back was cracked in several places. Screen severely scratched. Phone locked so unable to immediately see if it works. Spent over $800 would not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews for this phone based on issues with the seller. Granted, some of those reviews say it took a few weeks for the problems to appear so I’ll edit this if that happens, but wow was I happy with what I got. Not only did it come with a charger (there’s some debate on that in other reviews), but it even had a clear bumper case. That was neither expected nor necessary but I appreciated it (I bought a Unicorn Beetle case which I have used and loved before on other phones). There wasn’t a scratch on this phone and it started working right away for me. The battery seems to be holding up fine. All in all I’d say this seems like a steal. If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I’ll update this. UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with.
<<&&&&>>
The iPhone 7 I purchased was "certified refurbished" and labeled as "new" quality but doesn't work. The phone looks great, but when I first turned it on it was in a restart loop. This was a bad sign to begin with, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and connected it to my computer. When I finally got it to restore to factory settings, the screen started glitching to the point where there was nothing to stop it, and if it did get to the startup screen, it was non-responsive. The shipping took a few days, but at least it came when scheduled. I have been unable to make contact with the company, but I will update my review if they are able to fix the issue and if I receive a working phone. Update: Ended up returning the phone and purchasing elsewhere. The company was cooperative with the return. Of course this could have been a one-off issue
<<&&&&>>
Exactly as described. Unlocked . Worked immediately in excellent condition. Battery is in prime condition. I believe the people that are reading negative reviews are using iPhones that they received from these guys to try and put their SIM card from Verizon or Sprint which are still pulling from cdma based networks which is why it's not going to work The phone is GSM unlocked not factory unlocked there is a big difference the sooner people educate themselves on the difference the better off our society will be
<<&&&&>>
I am very disappointed!!! I've ordered and had success with a previous refurbished phone. However, this iphone 7 with 128 GB was stated as unlocked, which it was. It was stated that it was Verizon compatible. It clearly was not. The Verizon techs stated that the system on this phone had to be from another country whose systems are totally incompatible with US carrier systems. We spent hours at the Verizon store just to have to purchase a brand new phone from them. I watched. They tried everything to make my refurbished work. Very frustrated and never doing this refurbished phone thing again.
<<&&&&>>
It’s a scam!! The screen doesn’t respond properly so and the battery dies within one hour. I highly recommend that NO ONE gets this product and it should be taken off Amazon immediately. I don’t want everyone to make the same mistake I did by buying this horrible product.
<<&&&&>>
Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone. I've had it for a month and the screen has started going black every few minutes, and sometimes it freaks out and tells me I have no way to connect to wifi or cell coverage (despite being somewhere with wifi and usually 4G). I'm returning before the problems escalate. Note- it doesn't come with a charger or with headphones.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is not Verizon compatible! The side of the package says UNLK/T-Mobile. Tried to activate it anyways and it couldn't be.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone based off carrier compatibility. It is clearly stated that this phone will work with Verizon Wireless. After 2 hours on the phone with tech support, they finally let us know that this (t-moble) phone will only work on the (t-mobile and ATT) networks.
<<&&&&>>
This arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it. It came much earlier than expected which is amazing! I see many reviews that say it isn't compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when I activated it with Sprint. And despite its price it works great! It's not slow and the battery doesn't drain too quickly or anything like that. I, honestly, highly recommend this product!! 5 Stars all the way!
<<&&&&>>
Before I even turned it on I tried to put it in a case and saw that the screen had popped out of the casing. The phone wouldn't turn on so I tried to charge it. The cable was loose in the charging port and the phone never powered on!!
<<&&&&>>
I’ve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I’ve played with the X, and was disappointed. Pros: Battery life is superior to anything I’ve owned Reception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone. The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It’s flawless in your hands. It’s faster than any galaxy or iPhone I’ve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9) The apps are just designed better. I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I’ve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It’s constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it’s BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it’s very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. Stunning Cons: Pricey No headphone jack All glass (doesn’t bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on. No headphones included No cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it’s a non issue) The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality) Overall this truly is an incredible device.
<<&&&&>>
INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I’ve also had Androids and many different types of PC’s. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it’s the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won’t always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.
<<&&&&>>
Face ID does not work
<<&&&&>>
I have had this phone for 33 days and it just stopped working for no reason!!!! I paid $1000 for this phone this is UNACCEPTABLE!!!
<<&&&&>>
Product had scratches on the screen. Definitely heavily used.
<<&&&&>>
I know is use phones but for the price of $700 it looks in a bad condition unfortunately you take a risk when you buy phones with out been able to see them and are used and I am not happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews. I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone. EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all. I'm considering doing a return.
<<&&&&>>
El celular es excelente.
<<&&&&>>
I bought this phone for my son that lives in Jamaica as a Christmas gift. You see I was so nervous and skeptical to buy this phone. because of the mixed reviews. the phone came with a charger, the pin to pull out the SIM card draw, a receipt and a instruction card if you’re gonna send it back. The phone and everything mentioned was packed in a nice box. The phone is clean and looks brand new. no scratches or scrapes. it’s also unlocked which is what i payEd for. Everything on the phone seems to be working fine for now, I’ll update later if anything changes. So far I’m happy with my purchase. no complaints
<<&&&&>>
Totalmente descontento con el Iphone. No estaba desbloqueado y no funciona para ninguna compañia. Es una vergüenza porque fue un engaño porque el Iphone lo llevaba para otro país. Sino es porque me doy cuenta a tiempo.
<<&&&&>>
Great phone took awhile to arrive
<<&&&&>>
Bought this for a friend and it never worked. The serial number is invalid. I believe this is complete fake
<<&&&&>>
Fue un fraude la compra
<<&&&&>>
THERE IS NO SIM CARD TRAY!!!😡
<<&&&&>>
Almost new in perfect condition with no issues. No earphones
<<&&&&>>
I've read all the bad reviews and can't help but think there is a serious disconnect between the phones sent to these folks and the ones who have posted the good reviews. My IPhoneX plus with 512gb arrived in absolutely perfect condition. Well, OK, It didn't have all that glamorous packaging that Apple provides but we all know how that adds to the bottom line. I did not need an exciting unboxing experience, I needed a good iPhone X Plus and that is exactly what I received. It's difficult to believe the phone I received was not completely brand new and I can't imagine a phone ordered from Apple to arrive in better condition.
<<&&&&>>
Screen will not turn on. Haven't been able to use the phone at all. One of the screws on the bottom of the phone appears to have a different thread pattern as well.
<<&&&&>>
Buenas tardes. El 27 de agosto se aprobó la devolución de este teléfono, sin embargo hasta la presente fecha ( 11 de octubre ) no se ha hecho el reembolso en mi tarjeta de crédito. Por favor su ayuda. Saludos
<<&&&&>>
First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive. So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.
<<&&&&>>
I was reading reviews of how it was a bad product, which made me not want to purchase from here but then it came in the mail and although it didn’t come with original box and charger the phone is perfect 10/10. so far I love it
<<&&&&>>
I like this phone
<<&&&&>>
I bought the renewed one because I think new iPhone is way overpriced. Just received my order today and it is bit of disappointment. It didn’t come with genuine Apple charger and earphone is not included. Phone shows scratch marks all around bezel. Luckily screen is OK because there is a screen protector. But the protector was put on slanted so it is an eye sore itself. And it is the glass type protector, I will have to figure out how to remove it myself. So far the phone itself functions OK and hopefully it will last a while. Just this buying experience is not what I expected.
<<&&&&>>
Not unlocked. Do not buy
<<&&&&>>
When I purchased this phone from BuySPRY I was a little skeptical it would not arrive in good condition due to other comments saying they received theirs with scratches and cracks. Mine came in great condition with no scratches but just a little ware on the sides but nothing major. The battery life of this phone is amazing and last me all day and then some. I got it for an amazing price and I am very happy with my purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Came in mint condition. Practically new. Fully unlocked so I could just swap my StraightTalk SIM card over and use my old iPhone to transfer it easily. 256GB storage is amazing. Camera quality it’s out of this world. I love it! Only downside was the shipping time. It took a little bit longer than the typical Prime Free Two-Day shipping. Was still free on prime but took around 5 days. Might be different depending on what seller you buy from. Other than that I’m very happy! I’ve been long over due for a phone upgrade with me still having a iPhone 6S Plus before I got this one lol
<<&&&&>>
I can't find enough good words to say regarding this seller and the iPhone XS Max. It arrived a day ahead of the scheduled delivery, and it is absolutely in brand-new condition. You would not be able to see a difference between this phone and one brand-new from an Apple store. It was packaged with care and also had a genuine Apple charger and cable. I've tested every feature and all are working. The SIM from my iPhone 5c worked immediately when I powered it up and went through the setup, and I made my first call within three minutes of opening the box. I saved at least $450 in buying a renewed phone instead of a new one, yet I essentially have a new phone. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.

I have been debating as to how I should write this as a avid Apple user I’m very happy with the product I’m a little upset that when I received my used apple iPhone XS max I ordered the Verizon Version and instead receive the Sim card unlocked version the phone did come with a Screen protector but it was to hide the deep scratches in the screen the Battery life is down to 92% Capability I’m happy but upset at the same time also I have to update this review as I have just discovered the flash and rear camera is not working at all can’t even take a photo or use the flashlight
<<&&&&>>
Nice product
<<&&&&>>
Ordered: Unlocked iPhone Xs Max Silver-(256GB) I’ve seen a few one star reviews, so here’s a full honest review. The phone arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was light, but also secured. After un-wrapping the phone. I’ve noticed it had no front/back glass scratches or cracks. However, it did have hardly noticeable chips on the metal sides. The phone was also a little dirty around the edges and camera. (Which was easy to remove and back clean!) As promised the phone was unlocked with 256GB.
<<&&&&>>
I got this phone in June, I can't be happier. Came in like new condition, battery at a 100% can last over 24hrs of normal use (I upgraded from iphone 6s which battery lasted merely 6-8hrs). I would really recommend this phone.
<<&&&&>>
It works and performs as described. The iPhone is way faster than my old iPhone 6plus. Although it is the exact same dimensions as the old phone. Except for the camera lense on the back. Otherwise an excellent product. Thanks
<<&&&&>>
Looks like new, a little bit of dust in the top front microphone but a fine bristle brush helped get 90% of that dust out. Battery works great, screen unscratched, back unscratched, I love it. Great upgrade. NEVER BUYING A NEW iPHONE AGAIN. Amazon Renewed is the way to go.
<<&&&&>>
El telefono esta Like new!!! Funcionamiento perfecto, quizas la vida util de la bateria no es la del cel nuevo, pero diria que esta al 85%.... Con gran uso de redes sociales me alcanza 12 horas sin recargar
<<&&&&>>
This damn phone is not unlocked”$???????????
<<&&&&>>
I am very much getting what I expected out this product, and I am just happy. It might have have been a little pricey, but hey, life is not always all about money!
<<&&&&>>
Only had the phone for a day and it won’t let anyone call me and won’t let me make outgoing calls
<<&&&&>>
Like all apple phones you know what you’re getting. If you want a phone that does more and goes beyond expectations you might be disappointed especially for the price you pay, but you’re basically paying for the name, “premium” feel, and ease of use. If you’re looking for great phones to get instead check out the Pixels, Galaxies, or the One Plus series of phones for great alternatives; but so far this phone has been great for me, I will try to give updates on any negative or positive changes. So finally there is a phone out for everyone so look around and find what works best for you.
<<&&&&>>
I found the phone having various glitches throughout its use. For one, the camera is lower quality than the same phone that my friends had and had purchased new. It would often get very hot. Lots of apps would crash and it would run slowly. Often the front camera would not be as receptive and it would crash. The camera would often remain black and wouldn't work until I reset the whole phone. Lots of problems in general. Don't recommend...
<<&&&&>>
I really love my new phone, I have more than a week used and I can’t complain I was new unlocked, 256 gb and the battery is 100%
<<&&&&>>
Hey i got to say the phone looks really new shoutout to networkstore for this really good product it just came today because i bought as an gift the person is loving it i would give 5 stars but just because its the first day im gonna play it safe but really good phone so far and it looks super new highly recommend if you dont wanna pay full price no orginal box but comes with charger and it is great....!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
The product arrived on time. The phone looked absolutely brand new. It came with a charger in a box. I have been using it for a week, haven’t found a problem at all. The phone is in perfect shape and does not show any problem. Definitely recommended
<<&&&&>>
Let me start by saying phone is exactly as described. It’s also in very good condition based on the price. However, I almost thought I had been duped, the box the phone came in was one of those Walmart $50 “smart” phones, and the charger and cube were not the original. Which I understand, because of the low low price. I cannot stress this enough, the phone is in almost a perfect condition, there are a few scratches on the screen, but they are very superficial, and the phone runs just like new. Certainly recommend it, and this seller as well.
<<&&&&>>
It’s not working and has problems. This phone has liquid damage and has been sent for Apple to repair, and the problem is not solved because it cost 599 to repair. Now they are selling it to me.
<<&&&&>>
El celular no me sirvió para t-mobile quiero regresarlo
<<&&&&>>
A choice between the iPhone 2019 Pro/Max and the X/XS Max pointed me towards the X. Phone is beyond pristine. If you're in the market for one, I suggest you ante up $20 and get a screen protector. BO.FYI
<<&&&&>>
I received my phone promptly and it is in like new condition. It meets and exceeds my expectations. Thank you:)
<<&&&&>>
This phone is not unlocked,. Scam!
<<&&&&>>
Me encanta el artículo, está perfecto , impecable como nuevo, lo único es que la batería dura poco... pensé que duraría más... pero por lo demás ... maravilloso
<<&&&&>>
i bought the phone fully unlocked but when i went to get a service it says it’s locked to AT&T !!! I am more then pissed ! Because my service is TMobile so i can’t do anything with this phone unless i pay someone to unlock it ! When i payed all this money for this phone to already be unlocked!!
<<&&&&>>
All I gotta say is this phone was definitely worth it! I was skeptical buying a renewed phone since some people have had problems with locked phones, etc. (I think it can depend on who you buy it from) My phone came in perfect condition, not a blemish on it and it was unlocked! Couldn’t have asked for a better phone and I’m so happy! I have a new phone now and saved so much by buying renewed :D
<<&&&&>>
Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  Phone arrived and screen WAS flickering . There is no way the seller did not know about this issue . Phone was still under warranty and took it to Apple to be repaired . Disappointed that I had to take time to take it to Apple to have it repaired . Not a trustworthy seller at all
<<&&&&>>
it is in a very good condition.
<<&&&&>>
YOU SHOULD DEF BUY THIS !!!!! iphone didn’t come in apple box. but accessories look like apple accessories. phone like brand new. no scratches or anything. very happy w this company.
<<&&&&>>
over 1 month and operated perfectly, glad I went with the max.
<<&&&&>>
Horrible. Phone came locked unable to use with any carrier
<<&&&&>>
Very good product. Screen protector need to be bought additionally
<<&&&&>>
Specs arrived as ordered. Phone works perfectly, battery life is as new. I'm not giving 5 stars because phone has a tiny scratch (barely noticeable) one third of the way from the bottom of the screen. Other than that, everything is as I hoped it would be. I guess I was luckier than most people here.
<<&&&&>>
I was very pleasantly surprised with this phone. When you buy refurbished, you never really know what you will get. However, I was one of the lucky ones and this phone seemed brand new! No marks, no defects, top notch performance, it’s almost like somebody bought it new and immediately sent it back without using it. An excellent buy for sure!
<<&&&&>>
It's actually giving a bit of problems
<<&&&&>>
I had to return the 256gb gold unlocked phone. It was definitely not unlocked and had few scratches on the back. Not to noticeable but just couldn’t get it connected with my service.
<<&&&&>>
Basically indistinguishable from a new phone. Had a minor hiccup with voicemail activation on Verizon that was resolved by calling them. Doesn't come with headphones or a dongle; comes with a non-OEM charger and cable.
<<&&&&>>
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
<<&&&&>>
Ok
<<&&&&>>
Cheap charging wire
<<&&&&>>
I was very apprehensive buying a used phone online with all the “horror” stories I’ve heard. Seemed like a reputable seller and the item arrived as described without issue.
<<&&&&>>
Showed up with off brand charger and adapter and a shattered camera. Would not recommend.
<<&&&&>>
Bought as Xmas gift for my wife, she likes it
<<&&&&>>
Ordered this phone upgrading from a iphone 5s. I was worried to order from amazon to spend $850 on a phone like this. I got the phone quickly within 3 days, and not a scratch on it, battery life is great. no issues whatsoever. Very happy with the purchase.
<<&&&&>>
El tel esta como nuevo intacto apesar de no ser certificado por Apple estoy feliz
<<&&&&>>
Was a value of money, was same as i saw in youtube not malfunctions or any bad features and happy to deal with them.
<<&&&&>>
Nunca me llegó el celular!!! No me dan solución
<<&&&&>>
I’ve been using this for about a week and I’m convinced that it’s a new phone. The only thing that worries me is in a week my maximum battery capacity dropped 8%. But overall the phone is great.
<<&&&&>>
Face ID does not work. A feature I purchased this phone specifically for.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect condition, easy to sync to my network and cloud 10/10
<<&&&&>>
I was scare after reading horribles reviews but it work perfectly and literally no scratches
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono 9.5/10 Todo bien, me sirve perfecto en ECUADOR

No Lo he recibido ese artículo, intente de todas las formas recibir, o el reembolso(después de un mes intentando recibir lo producto), y nada. Ahora hice uno reporte policial.

Great phone for price...refurbished but looked like new, no issues so far, completely unlocked and working perfectly

Can’t give a review on phone because when the package came everything was in there but the phone!.!. Worst experience I’ve ever had on Amazon.

Paid for a 256gb Gold XSmax, but received a 64gb Gray Xs max. Sigh
<<&&&&>>
A brand new phone costs 100 bucks cheaper as of 4/30/2019
<<&&&&>>
The same amount is at the apple store brand new and its sealed and its also unlocked right from the Manufactuer Apple. if it was like 5-700 I would say ok its cheaper. My rating is not on the phone, its on the fact that your paying too much for a referbished (renewed phone). I may as well go to Apple and pay full price!!!!!!
<<&&&&>>
why waste so much money on a renewed phone when the NEW one on apple is for $150 less. What a rip off
<<&&&&>>
I would recommend to buy it from the apple store since the prices are pretty similar and a lot of different reasons
<<&&&&>>
This product is the second iPhone i have owned since the screen came out OLED and without a home button. I received this device and my initial impressions was that it was a bit large and heavier then iPhone's i have had in the past . I upgraded from an iPhone X and over time i have become pretty attached to the clarity of the screen and display overall. The performance of this phone accompanied by the clear camera and 4K video quality, certainly brings much to the table . The things i disliked about this phone are the lightning connector is still present several years later as well as the phone gets hot during using the maps application when i am traveling in my car . This phone can drain a battery heavily .
<<&&&&>>
You don’t realize how heavy a phone can be until you are on it 6 hours a day. This phone starts to deteriorate pretty quickly; it’s only been around 5 months and the screen does not work as well; and there are so many actions this phone can do; I spent like guessing 5 to 10 percent of my time on it; correcting errors. 20 percent of the time I touch an icon; it doesn’t activate; but instead swipes left or right. I should be an expert on touching icons by now; yet still it happens. The apps this phone can use are really great and fun; but they need to seriously work on a hands free device and triple their man hours on the glitches and errors. Let the Chinese use the newest IOS for a year before releasing to the rest of the world; so they can deal with all the problems. One more thing; stop making the outside of the phone so slick; The slightest degree this phone is from horizontal, and there it falls off. You have to take the case off because it gets too hot, too quick. My screen dims like every five minutes. I could go on and on; but Apple knows; it’s just about the money for them.
<<&&&&>>
I like it best purchase I’ve made!!! 😁
<<&&&&>>
Me gusta la Iphone. La telefone es muy rápido. Cuando recogo la telefone mi siento felize. La cámara en la telefone is fabuloso. La calculadora en la telefone es la razon me hacer bueno en mi universidad. Mi ciudad es muy grande y la mapa en la telephone es muy bueno tener. La telfone es ahora algo que necesito.
<<&&&&>>
This phone is quite amazing and powerful, however the price is wild and to be completely honest with you, doesn't make up for what you bought it for.
<<&&&&>>
I bought one of these phones Currently using it rite now and the Face ID does not work I shipped it to my mother in the US then and she brought it to Jamaica to me so it was hard for me to send it back.....all I’m saying is test ur products properly b4 selling them
<<&&&&>>
Está muy bien pero el cargador q me mandaron no sirve no es el original y no trae audífonos 😕☹️
<<&&&&>>
I'm glad I checked out the reviews before buying I'm not about to waste any $800 to $1,000
<<&&&&>>
Amazon como siempre muy serio y responsable el teléfono llegó sin un solo detalle muy buena su presentación y protección impecable .
<<&&&&>>
Appearance good ; operation good; battery life 96% ; Lenovo charger ; Energizer cable ; unknown gift box. For me, satisfaction!
<<&&&&>>
There bad dog
<<&&&&>>
The phone is not unlocked. I can’t use it with my t-mobile. It only works with Verizon sim. Seller hasn’t refunded. They are ripping people off. I am highly disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
First phone was not unlocked. I got blocked my network after putting the SIM card in it and it's been a nightmare to get my old phone working again with he SIM card. Apparently the phone is still hooked up to its old phone network and now I can't use it or my old phone. Requested a replacement hoping that the replacement won't have the same issue......
<<&&&&>>
El teléfono me llego en excelentes condiciones, caja, cargador y cable originales, pantalla perfecta, rendimiento de batería genial, totalmente desbloqueado para cualquier operadora, no incluyen los audífonos, pero eso no fue un problema para mi..
<<&&&&>>
I know it would have been great, but I ordered it by mistake. Had to send it back.
<<&&&&>>
Purchased a “renewed” XS Max a few weeks ago with some trepidation. However, it looks and operates like brand new. Didn’t get the insurance since it didn’t look like a good deal. I’m VERY happy with my decision and enjoy the phone more since I didn’t have to pay the full price.
<<&&&&>>
I hesitated to buy at first as it was renewed. Also the comments inflicted on me. But after I got the iphone, it was orijinal and no signs of use was on it. Do not believe in the baf comments. It is orijinal and I recommend to be bought. That is it.
<<&&&&>>
The phone worked like brand new when I received and is still working strong
<<&&&&>>
Love it! I really was skeptical and expecting the worst, but it was in pristine condition! Works perfectly; However, I did buy the 2 year protection...just in case ;)
<<&&&&>>
BATTERY WAS SMOKING AND BURNED ME SO I THREW IT AWAY DO NOT BUY
<<&&&&>>
Phone is fine, aside from I ordered silver and I got a white or pearly white color. Which is not what I wanted.
<<&&&&>>
I expected the refurbished iPhone XS Max to come with all items it was originally sold with. The audio phones were not included. This is especially annoying because only audio phones with a special plugin will work on this iPhone.
<<&&&&>>
Perfect 100% condition from NETWORKSTORE. And battery was at 100%
<<&&&&>>
Solid packaging, item appears new, comes with charger, functions well, item as described.
<<&&&&>>
Good quality and good price, easy to use!
<<&&&&>>
Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here’s why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn’t find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that’s different from Samsung, it’s better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn’t burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it’s battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don’t lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don’t mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That’s over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I’m still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy’s S Voice. I don’t have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that’s significantly faster especially when you’re in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that’s not a fair comparison but it’s reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can’t compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It’s not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don’t take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don’t have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don’t own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you’re spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you’re in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can’t believe I waited this long to switch. There was a time when I loved the Galaxy but that was when I first bought it.
<<&&&&>>
Well i pad 1400$ for it so that’s crazy but phone is amazing and takes the best pictures of any phone in my family and i have not had a single issue in last 8 months
<<&&&&>>
Very poor. Not in original packaging. It did not have earphones and instruction manual. Very unsatisfactory buy. I would like my money back. The phone is useless, a piece of garbage
<<&&&&>>
So far so good. The camera makes a green fuzzy picture every now and then but I guess that’s what happens when you get this phone at a good price. So far no issue besides that. Shipped quick.! UPDATE: 10/18/19 my camera has not made any green fuzz in awhile. Everything works as expected. Great phone great quality barely used. First time iPhone user from android 10 years and I’m glad I switched.
<<&&&&>>
Will make an updated review in 1 months time.
<<&&&&>>
I absolutely love this phone. Perfect screen size and razor sharp resolution, epic camera, fantastic battery life. I love how it feels in my hand and obviously it's a beautiful looking phone. It is hands down the best iPhone, and I've had all of them.
<<&&&&>>
So surprised by how amazing the camera is on this phone, it surpasses all my expectations when it comes to cameras on smartphones
<<&&&&>>
Over 1 month and operated perfectly, glad I went with the max.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in spectacular condition, no flaws at all, works like new and would definitely recommend 10/10
<<&&&&>>
Workes Great!!!!
<<&&&&>>
I love
<<&&&&>>
I was very hesitant about buying an iPhone off of Amazon, but I did it and was not disappointed. It came with 100% battery life, so it basically was brand new. It came with a charger and cube (plug), but that's it. Sorry to disappoint those who into that airpod life. No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down. But what it lacks in that feature, the iPhone delivers in the portrait camera mode, I seriously am in love with the blur feature. Sincerely, A very satisfied Amazon customer
<<&&&&>>
Phone was in perfect condition and works great but came without EarPods and the the lightning to earphone jack adapter that is pictured with “what’s in the box”. If you must replace these, the $20 open box discount is not worth it. If I did not already have Bluetooth headphones, and received Amazon Visa discount points, I would have returned.
<<&&&&>>
The phone is froze up and unable to use. Very poor product *Edit* within five minutes of talking with Amazon tech support the started working just fine
<<&&&&>>
One - It comes in a weird box Two it had more scuffs and scratches than I’d like for the price 3 - I had to return it because of how over all lame it came and how it showed up/ battery was pretty warn/scratches/ and I didn’t get the awesome feeling of unboxing it..
<<&&&&>>
WISH I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO! NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE
<<&&&&>>
Thanks , i feeling very nice satisfacción with a new cellphone. Look like brand new.
<<&&&&>>
Suddenly Wifi is not working properly and i could see phone feels hot with calls dropping abruptly . I am really not sure of what to do .
<<&&&&>>
First off I’m going to say that I recieved and iPhone xs MAX, not the standard xs like it’s advertised. Not a big deal to me, but it might be to some people. Also as the other review states, it comes with a charger but not the headphones or the headphone adapter. Other than that it looks brand new and came very quickly! Overall very satisfied. Honestly though, since this is the same price as a new xs, I would probably recommend just buying a brand new one instead.
<<&&&&>>
Item arrived with cracked screen, no refund issue still.
<<&&&&>>
The phone was broken, the front microphone was not working when we got it. It took a couple days to figure it out but after we did I contacted the seller for help. They responded very quickly and told me I could either return it to them for another "renewed" one or take it to the Apple store since it was still under warranty. We took it to the Apple store. They looked at it and did some diagnostics right in the store and the phone self reported that the microphone was broken. Dealing with Apple was horrible - in short it took 2 months, 3 trips (7 hours total) at the the Apple store before we had a phone that worked. The renewed cellular people were nice and quick to respond but the fact that the phone self reported a broken microphone and they still sold it is upsetting. This phone should not have been sold and they could easily tell it was not fixed (the "scan" took 2 minutes in the store). I can't hold the horrible experience at Apple against this seller but from Apple I got a new phone and I didn't want to take the chance on another renewed one from the seller - as it was obvious their check is not thorough. In short next time I am going to just get the new phone.
<<&&&&>>
phone was not in as good of shape as i expected at this price point. the battery life has consistently gotten worse until the point it can no longer hold charge. i’ve contacted about a return and they have yet to offer any support
<<&&&&>>
Firstly, this iphone is really like new. Battery life %100. But i don’t believe the charging cable is original. Cuz as seen in the photos, The material is really poor quality, the cable shape is distorted with a slight bending. As is known, it is a factor that affects charging and phone performance.
<<&&&&>>
I really would leave 0 stars if it were possible. Be careful with "renewed" phones on Amazon. I left it charging almost 2 whole days and it never turned on. And yes I tried different chargers. Went to different outlets and the phone would never turn on. It also did not look new as mentioned. I will never ever buy a "renewed" product off of anyone on Amazon. It is just really frustrating because what if I needed a phone by a certain day and I am relying on Amazon do deliver a perfectly working phone. And now I am unfortunately just involved in a hassle.
<<&&&&>>
It's compatible with my carrier (metro by t-mobile) all I had to do was ask. It doesn't appear to have any preexisting problems. I switched over from android and to my surprise it didn't take long to get fully acclimated to iOS (maybe a day or two). I forget what shipping option I chose (I think 1 day or something) but it arrived pretty quickly (within US i believe), definitely worth the extra bucks.
<<&&&&>>
Do not buy this phone. It has so many problems like it won’t charge and the battery life is terrible. Just buy it from apple itself because it will be new.
<<&&&&>>
This is a great iPhone. I got it for my grandpa who upgraded from an iPhone 6. The 11 was already announced when we got this, but he didn't like the 11 (not pro) because it was bigger and more expensive and the screen on this is a lot better. The phone as a whole is alright. The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone. This can be a good deal over the iPhone 11 pro, especially if you aren't going to be using a wide angle lens.

The phone had a larger than expected scratch on the screen. Scratch was about 1 inch and half. Maybe i had a bad unit. It was clean everywhere else and they put the screen protector on top of the screen But for the price and like new condition it stated on the description it was disappointing.

I was skeptical about ordering this phone after reading all the comments.. I gave it a shot and ordered a gold xs 256gb . After receiving the product and started using it I realized that the battery was decreasing rapidly so I rushed and checked the battery life which showed 96% I then received an update from apple which kinda fixed the battery life problem I had to buy a battery case in order to use it for a full day .. my other fault was that I couldn’t increase the volume over 50% or else the speakers would start to distort which is horrible.. I contacted Amazon for a partial refund since I could not return the phone because I’m currently on a business trip but all I got was it wasn’t possible... please be careful when u purchase this item
<<&&&&>>
No por que mitieron esta bloqueado si neli pueden desbloquear para no recordarlo el celular es delo peor está persona no me quiso pagar mi dinero 123 mala persona no le coplen nada
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived in great condition with 97% battery capacity. Works very well. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 I purchased back in 2015. This phone is a spectacular upgrade and works in every way I want it to. Totally worth buying renewed over new. I love just staring at how beautiful it is before I put a case on it.
<<&&&&>>
Was nervous ordering refurbished but I cannot see any evidence it was ever touched. Battery shows 100% capacity, no scratches or marks anywhere and fully unlocked, tried sprint, att, and cricket Sim and all register and operate without issue.
<<&&&&>>
i orderd a phone for my son and when it came it was not the phone i even ordred it was a different cell phone so i had to return it
<<&&&&>>
I was very nervous about buying a renewed product this expensive, but I've had the phone for a month or two and love it. Works great, no problems and in great condition. As far as value for the money, Apple will never rate high in that category for me. lol
<<&&&&>>
WOW! I’m a very skeptical shopper. I thought the description and the price for my phone was too good to be true. My phone was an exact match of the description and I could not be happier. Absolutely spotless, free of marks or scratches. The battery life is currently the same what would be on a new phone. Impressed with the seller’s ability to match a description with the product. I was very skeptical since pictures were not even posted of the phone. I just shopped for months and went with the best seller reviews. Which is why I am choosing to leave you with my experience. No doubt I will buy from this seller again.
<<&&&&>>
The iphone is in good condition externally. But internally there was a serious issue with the battery and Face id would never work. Make sure to check the phone battery and Face id feature working.
<<&&&&>>
With this price you don’t need to get a refurbished phone when a new one is $40 more
<<&&&&>>
So happy with my iPhone XS Battery is at a 90% screen is flawless. Back glass is flawless. Face ID works. So far I’m happy. You get 90 Day with amazon and also from the seller. happy Happy Happy.
<<&&&&>>
El artículo llego en buenas condiciones estéticas pero no funciona el face id y la pantalla tiene flashes y cambia de color. No funciona correctamente
<<&&&&>>
Easy to set up, perfect condition! Fair price.
<<&&&&>>
two different phone both said fully unlocked per amazon/seller and both were tied to a different carrier..
<<&&&&>>
The phone arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or damage of any kind, actually it's like new. I tested the battery life and it is in excelent condition too. The phone is unlocked as advertised.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came with dents, cracks and scratches along the edges of the screen, overall moderate condition but not worth the price paid honestly, maybe $600 max but that’s my opinion. I’d rather not wait more time to return it and get a new one since it will just waste time to get an item with the exact same condition back. Phone came with a cheap knockoff lightning charger, only charges on one side and overheats often. Shipping was fast and reliable. Item is great honestly but I would recommend buying the max same storage and everything because it’s the same price with other sellers.
<<&&&&>>
I returned it on next day as the speaker of phone was not working. Disappointed.
<<&&&&>>
I had to get in and write an initial review so that anyone considering this phone for a gift would feel confident with their purchase. Anytime you see “renewed” you expect something less than new but your not sure how it will compare to new. Honestly in this case you would not know the difference. I was pleasantly surprised. I received this phone yesterday and it is perfect as if I just unboxed a new iPhone XS. The phone powered on and had 100% battery. I am so please with this phone. It also arrived 4 days ahead of the expected delivery date. Thank you CellCow.
<<&&&&>>
Lucia y está como. Nuevo
<<&&&&>>
Love it ! It’s brand brand new phone and I can’t ask for more ! Thank you
<<&&&&>>
When I say this phone came like new, I mean it actually had 0 scratches on it with 100% battery, so that was a nice surprise. I also confirmed with Apple to make sure the phone was real, It’s possible I I just got an excellent previous owner, but from my experience this was well worth it. A+++
<<&&&&>>
Came with 100% battery health (battery was new), packaged well, and came early. After around 5 hours of use everything seems to be working well. Also came with a 90 day warranty.
<<&&&&>>
Came in great condition and very satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
Love love love. Perfect condition in its appearance and no issues when using. Wrong color but that doesn’t matter to me. Very happy.
<<&&&&>>
It is good refurbisded phone. I like it.
<<&&&&>>
The device doesn’t even come in an apple box nor comes with apple certified charging cable or wall socket. The packaging was very poor. I did not expect Amazon Renewed standards to be so low.
<<&&&&>>
Im really impress wasn't to sure to get an iPhone from Amazon , wasn't to sure what i was going to receive . But I am really happy with the phone looks beautiful and works great no problem. This seller is really good won't mind buying form them again. Thank you
<<&&&&>>
This phone is absolutely awesome for the price. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but the phone came in perfect condition. It comes with a charger and box, but like the other reviews said, it doesn’t come with an adapter or the AirPods which was not an issue with me because it was such a good price. Definitely worth the buy, had no issues setting up
<<&&&&>>
I was a little skeptical at first about amazon renewed products due to the reviews that i was reading however everything came in good condition phone came with no box but the charger and the wall block , I had even seen people saying there phone arrived with less than 100% battery life. Mine however came with 100%. I recommended this phone to anyone looking for a XS in good condition for a good price.
<<&&&&>>
Accurate and quality product just love my new phone and love the delivery service super fast
<<&&&&>>
It's not original and I paid more than original I don't know what to say els
<<&&&&>>
Battery condition was at 89%, very minor scratches, and seems to be working like normal. Very pleased with this purchase!
<<&&&&>>
I ordered I Phone XS 256 GB and it shipped very fast and delivered in 3 days. I was worried about the quality of the renewed phone but when I opened it, it was like in new condition. no scratch and no dent. So far it is working great. 88 perfect battery health. The phone charger is not generic (not from apple) but working fine.
<<&&&&>>
Phone didn’t come with the headphones.. with the price you would think it would come in original packaging and all accessories. And if not the original accessories, you would think they would at least send other ones you can use. Phone works fine, ONLY COMES WITH THE CHARGING CABLE, not even the wall plug. So obnoxious. Won’t purchase from them again.
<<&&&&>>
I love my new phone!!! I use to buy my phone on eBay and I always end up with problems, but this phone is actually working pretty well for me
<<&&&&>>
Looked and felt like new. Everything works except the “selfie” camera. Makes a weird vertical red line on top of image. Not a deal breaker for me since Face-ID still works.
<<&&&&>>
Battary life was around 90%, Some skratches on the screen, though for value of money its quite fair : )
<<&&&&>>
Great value and condition. Arrived like new, no scratches, battery life at 98% I’m so happy with this purchase.
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived a day early. No scratches that I could find, phone looks brand new. 100% battery life. Seems to be completely functioning so far! I was hesitant to get a refurbished phone, but I’m glad I did! Worth the savings! It was just the phone and a charger, no other accessories.
<<&&&&>>
Great condition
<<&&&&>>
Apple iPhone XS is a great phone and the seller kept his side of the deal. However, when I received the phone, I was not impressed due to the small screen size. I have shipped it back through UPS; and ordered Apple iPhone XS Max, 6.5", 512GB instead.
<<&&&&>>
Para nada, esta todo flojo y no trae audífonos y el cargador es chino no es el Original no lo quiero
<<&&&&>>
It came within the promised time period and the item is close to being brand new. good value for money.
<<&&&&>>
Very clean refurbished phonr
<<&&&&>>
Purple line appeared on my screen and it won’t go away didn’t happen until after my return window closed
<<&&&&>>
No problem what's so ever
<<&&&&>>
Phone came in very used condition with huge scratches on the screen
<<&&&&>>
The phone keeps on freezing. It’s so slow! Not really the price I paid.
<<&&&&>>
Absolutely love it. It came unlocked. And it world’s wonderfully. I would take a picture but I’m using it to write this review.inwas skeptical but I’m glad I took the chance . Thanks !
<<&&&&>>
Like new
<<&&&&>>
Thanks seller my device looks like new. I upgraded from the se and I’m glad I saved 200 bucks good deal!
<<&&&&>>
Just like a new
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks and works great!
<<&&&&>>
As a renewed product I was a bit unsure buying this product. However everything seems okay with a full battery life. Unfortunately doesn’t come with headphones.
<<&&&&>>
was hoping to use music for ring tones but didnt work the way an android works but by far a better security dydtem on an iphone.
<<&&&&>>
Like brand new!!!
<<&&&&>>
Works great
<<&&&&>>
The seller was iPower Resale Inc, and the iPhone was in a good condition. Minor scratches on the screen, and battery was 91% of peak performance.
<<&&&&>>
Very good came with case and screen protector which made me appreciate the work from seller or else my phone would have been cracked severely
<<&&&&>>
Solid phone. Easy set up. No issues with it being unlocked. No marks. No flaws. Battery lasts all day with lots of active use.
<<&&&&>>
Good condition but the screen is a bit scratched all in all it’s in good condition.
<<&&&&>>
Just what it described
<<&&&&>>
Everything works well... except the speakers. It sounds too low (sounds like it once entered water)...
<<&&&&>>
Como nuevo
<<&&&&>>
Phone arrived early and in like new condition. Extremely satisfied and would recommend
<<&&&&>>
I bought an Apple iPhone XS, 512GB, Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed). Works and looks like new. No scratches or scuffs.
<<&&&&>>
Phone came exactly as described, looks and works like an almost brand-new phone! I’m satisfied.
<<&&&&>>
Phone looks brand new and worked perfectly with xfinity mobile. Definitely would buy again in the future.
<<&&&&>>
I just purchased phone yesterday. The phone looks good but I can barely hear my calls. It’s only loud on speaker.
<<&&&&>>
To summarize it all, I would buy again & encourage anyone to buy too.
<<&&&&>>
Excellent condition, no scratches, looks brand new. Battery at 100% health/maximum capacity.
<<&&&&>>

Arrived today, seems no problem but a really little bit of scratches on the edges. But it's not appear. Came with just charger and lightning usb. After having this for 4 days, i can tell you it was a good deal, at least for me!
<<&&&&>>
Wish i could give them 6!!!! POSITIVE Experience
<<&&&&>>
I had iPhone XS and it was my first iPhone. For the first two months it worked fine. The problems started with iOS updates. The first update didn't install and some apps stopped working. After the support people fixed it, the phone started to shut down on its own. The next update turned the phone into a brick. When I tried to turn it on, it would display that "Connect to iTunes" picture. At the Apple store the technician magically revived the phone using a new update but the very next day the phone started to drop wifi connection. I think the phone had serious hardware problems but Apple engineers figured out how to partially overcome the problems through software tricks. This is how Apple avoids replacing a bad phone with a new one. I ended up paying for an upgrade.
<<&&&&>>
Ok I got a space gray iPhone XS with 256GB and I was happy to get it, it came in a odd box but I didn’t really care about that I got the phone and there are dings and scratch’s on The outer metal case of the phone and I can tell that I he front glass and LCD scream were replaced be the screen kinda drags the image like on a old computer we’re the image stays for a second, that was one thing I was annoyed about that but the second thing was that it sound like the bottom speaker was broken at one point and they bought another one but it is a really cheap speaker because at certain points it has a pitch of sound with it and it just doesn’t sound good the speaker next to the Face ID camera works perfectly just the one at the bottom of the phone is really bad me personally I don’t care if it has dings or scratch’s on the outer Metal frame of the phone it just really annoys me when they replace the speaker with a bad one and that they get a cheaper LCD screen just to save a little bit of money I mostly notice the bad cream when I’m scrolling on instagram, Twitter or YouTube it’s when you are scrolling that it is the most noticeable problem wouldn’t buy again if I new they replaced parts with bad ones also battery gets kinda worm/hot when charging or on FaceTime and sometimes just randomly but that may just happen when running powerful or changing so that may just be normal not to sure but the battery stays charged all day so not too worried about the battery
<<&&&&>>
I loved it
<<&&&&>>
I looked at plenty reviews on this phone and found out it is nothing as described. This is not cool especially with such a high price.
<<&&&&>>
Best forever
<<&&&&>>
Honestly, I am tremendously satisfied with my purchase! There’s not a single difference between this and a brand new iphone..10/10 would buy again
<<&&&&>>
I would like to promote this product. I’m an instagram reviewer.
<<&&&&>>
These people tamper with the phones in order to unlock them, in my case it arrived unable to be updated to any version of iOS, rendering it useless, as you have to update to restore from backup. It's also unable to be restored to complete factory reset (through the recovery screen reset method using itunes). I got on the phone with them and they told me to "Wait a couple of days" because there's a problem at apple's end. Joke is on them, I talked to apple to try and get this thing updated but no matter what we tried it was impossible. The phone is a dud and they want me to wait a few days? Get real!
<<&&&&>>
Phone works fine, but the claim “looks like new” is a joke. I tried twice ordering from the same seller and the condition was worse the 2nd time. Covered in scratches and battery life depleted to 86%. Sad, irritating experience and sellers route of recourse was to call a phone number that responded “mailbox full”. Save yourself the frustration and order a phone directly from Apple.
<<&&&&>>
Compared to my 6, it’s different. Took some time getting used to no home screen. Occasionally the data/ wifi connection gets iffy. I still have the same plan as i did w my 6 and still the same circumstances (same home wifi, same job/ school ect) calls/ facetime will occasionally freeze/ sound fuzzy if i am not connected to wifi. That was never a problem with my 6 (my 6 was a GSM unlocked, idk if that has anything to do with it) I wear glass, and sometimes the face ID does not recognize me if i do not have them on. Battery life is great! And i like being able to access low power mode easier than having to go through settings all the time! All in all, good phone. I can tell you one thing, it is not worth $600+. The raw materials used to make iphones are worth less than $10. This was the best price i found for this phone, so thank you!!!
<<&&&&>>
I was Leary buying a renewed phone but was more than pleasantly surprised. The phone arrived totally unblemished and was just what I was looking for and was the right price. Setting up the phone which was a Verizon locked phone took only 15-20 minutes. Everything from my iPhone 7 was transferred first. I then installed the SIM card removed from the 7 and basically it was up and running. All of my worst fears never came true at all. The phone was totally wonderful and was exactly what was ordered. Looks feels and acts like a brand new iPhone XS.
<<&&&&>>
I know the price point is tempting but don’t do it! I just received the iPhone I ordered and it was terrible condition. I’m not sure how it passed their “quality inspection” but it came with scratches all over and with a broken screen... It gets better because now I have to pay for the return shipping. Just save yourself a headache and don’t do it.
<<&&&&>>
I was a little bit scared of my purchase given the one star review, but I was extremely pleasant Lee surprised. The phone I received looks completely brand new (I looked for any defects and I couldn’t find one), the battery health is 100, and the screen is great. I would highly recommend buying this if you’re interested.
<<&&&&>>
Phone screen was in pretty rough shape when we got it. Expected much more but spent $200 on a new screen and then found out that the phone was warped. Not in the condition that it was promised, very disappointed. Will not buy from here again.
<<&&&&>>
Problems with iOS, battery has half life, intermittently turns off on its own, marred back glass, scratched screen, screen adhesive seeping out of edges. Not as advertised, not carrier free (or unlocked), running a flash program overtop the iOS to simulate being unlocked which takes up both memory being used and ability to run programs.
<<&&&&>>
I got a new phone for half the price!!! 100% battery health, when received. I scrupulously went over it & THE ONLY blemish I could even notice was a barely-visual blemish on the camera bezel.
<<&&&&>>
Works great! Very happy with purchase. I’ve had it for several months now just to make sure the battery is still charging before leaving a review. Couldn’t be happier.
<<&&&&>>
It is almost new phone. No scratches whatsoever. I checked with Apple and the phone was just 4 months old. Really happy with my purchase. Thank you. It comes in generic white box and with just charger. No headphones included.
<<&&&&>>
Good Mobile, I like iPhone
<<&&&&>>
Good phone
<<&&&&>>
Like new condition! Love it!
<<&&&&>>
NOT WHAT IS DESCRIBED— DO NOT BUY
<<&&&&>>
Bought it thinking I was gonna be able to use it come to find out it would not connect to the apple network tried 3 different stores no one could get it to connect DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
<<&&&&>>
Llego pronto.en buenas condiciones
<<&&&&>>
Phone came, turned on and allowed me to set it up for about 20 minutes before turning off. Tried to hard reset, plug into iTunes etc... Stuck on Apple logo. Not recommended
<<&&&&>>
Product looks and works like new. Very much recommend.
<<&&&&>>
